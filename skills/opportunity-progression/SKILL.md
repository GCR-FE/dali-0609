# Opportunity Progression Management

Opportunity progression analysis tool. Upload your Scorecard to receive MEDDPICC/EDDIC gap analysis, stage alignment assessment, and recommended actions.

Structure: **Procedure 1 (Control) / Procedure 2 (Model) / Procedure 3 (View)**. Each phase in Control follows the form `call M.X → render view:phaseN.Z → WAIT`. Model produces only structured values; View contains only templates with placeholders (no logic); Control orchestrates.

## Trigger Patterns (for sales-agent-orchestrator)

This section tells the Dali orchestrator when to route user intent to `opportunity-progression`, and when to defer to other skills. The skill itself does not enforce these patterns — the orchestrator is the authority. The patterns below describe scenarios for which this skill is the right answer.

**Route to `opportunity-progression` when:**

- User explicitly requests MEDDPICC / EDDIC analysis, scoring, stage assessment, or "deal health" review.
  - 中文：评估卡 / Scorecard 分析 / MEDDPICC 评估 / 商机进展 / 商机阶段评估 / deal health / 阶段是否对齐
  - English: "score this deal", "MEDDPICC review", "stage assessment", "deal health check", "is this stuck"
- User uploads a Scorecard `.xlsx` file (orchestrator detects file extension + content shape).
- User describes opportunity progression challenges:
  - 中文：商机卡住了 / 推不动 / 不知道怎么推 / EB 还没接触 / 这单要不要推到下一阶段 / 季度 forecast 这单稳吗
  - English: "deal stuck / can't move forward / not sure how to advance / haven't talked to EB / can this go to next stage / forecast confidence on this deal"
- After foundational skills (`account-context` / `contact-profiling` / `competitive-intelligence`) have been run, recommend as natural next step ("现在我们对客户和竞争都有概念了，要不要跑 MEDDPICC 评估这单的 health？").
- Before scheduled review events: pipeline review, weekly forecast call, quarterly business review (QBR), GM 1-on-1, deal team sync.

**Do NOT route to `opportunity-progression` (defer to sibling skills) when:**

- User asks about a specific contact's persona / behavior → defer to `contact-profiling` / `cxo-personas`.
- User wants competitive intel only (battlecard, win/loss, displacement) → defer to `competitive-intelligence`.
- User wants strategic account synthesis (SWOT / TOWS / "should we even pursue this account") → defer to `business-insight`.
- User wants to draft customer-facing narrative for an EBC / executive briefing → defer to `bttroc` / `executive-briefing`.
- User wants to plan a single meeting / call → defer to `call-plan` / `engagement-plan`.
- User wants to debrief a meeting just held → defer to `post-meeting-report`.
- User wants to roleplay a customer conversation → defer to `simulator`.

**Output suitability (orchestrator can use this to plan downstream actions):**

- **Phase 1A Auto-Inference path** (`scorecard_source = "auto-inferred-accepted"`): suitable for quick-pulse health check, conversational deal review, or when the rep doesn't have time to fill a Scorecard. Marked with V.0.7 banner; precision is med/low. Not suitable for management review.
- **Phase 1A Upload / Form path** (`scorecard_source = "upload" | "form"`): suitable for management review, GM 1-on-1, QBR, sales kickoff. Precision is high.
- **Phase 7 HTML / PDF / Word**: shareable artifact. PDF preferred for management review (page-break optimized); HTML for in-tool viewing; Word for offline editing.
- **M.24 Model snapshot** (`~/.dali/opportunity-progression/snapshots/...`): machine-to-machine. Used by other Dali skills or downstream tools (e.g., a future "Snapshot Diff" skill, CRM writeback, cross-opportunity rollup).

**Re-trigger patterns (when to re-run the skill on the same opportunity):**

- Scorecard data updated → re-run with new upload.
- Significant deal event (EB meeting held, EDP signed, competitor displaced) → re-run to capture new state.
- Quarterly cadence even without explicit event → at least once per quarter for active opportunities.
- After running Phase 4 delegated skills (`account-context` / `solutions-search` / `competitive-intelligence`) — those skills' fresh output materially changes Phase 4 / Phase 5 outputs.

**Cross-skill orchestration hint:**

- If the user's intent is "evaluate this deal end-to-end" and the orchestrator has not yet run foundational skills, suggest running `account-context` and `contact-profiling` first, then `opportunity-progression` (so Phase 1A Option C / Phase 4 / Phase 5 have rich context to consume).
- Conversely, if the user has already run foundational skills, route directly to `opportunity-progression` and offer Phase 1A Option C as the default Scorecard source (since context is already present).

---

## Global Rules

- **Input boundary:** Scorecard (.xlsx) matching tier locked in Phase 1 — EDDIC for Simple, MEDDPICC for Strategic. Commodity needs no Scorecard.
- **Analysis Scope:** three tiers — **Commodity** (exits at Phase 1), **Simple** (EDDIC, 5 elements), **Strategic** (MEDDPICC, 8 elements). User self-classifies; agent does NOT scan or propose. Tier scope: see **M.1.1**.
- **Language:** auto-detected from active Scorecard sheet. MEDDPICC element codes (M, E, DC, DP, P, I, CH, CP) stay in English. Section headers, status tags, narrative follow detected `language`.

---

## Cross-Layer Rules

| Rule | Model | View |
|---|---|---|
| Data Attribution — every value carries source | M.0 | V.0.1 |
| Reserved Interface Transparency — show connection status | M tracks status flag | V.0.2 |
| Standing Warning Banner — when rollback recommended | M.13 sets `rollback_recommended` | V.0.3 |
| Inferred Scorecard Banner — when source = auto-inferred | M.3-Auto sets `scorecard_source` + `inference_confidence` | V.0.7 |
| Computation Sharing — multi-phase calc runs once | nodes tagged `[shared: ...]` | render cached value, never recompute |

PROCEDURE 1 — CONTROL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## C.0 Session State

The following variables are maintained across the entire skill session. After context compaction, Control re-reads this state to recover. Each phase that sets a flag is named.

| Flag | Type | Set by | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tier` | `Commodity` \| `Simple` \| `Strategic` | Phase 1 | All downstream phases (selects in-scope elements) |
| `scorecard_source` | `upload` \| `form` \| `auto-inferred-accepted` | Phase 1A | All Phase 2–7 view banners (V.0.7) |
| `inference_confidence` | `{overall: low\|med\|high, per_element: map}` \| `null` | Phase 1A-Auto (M.3-Auto) | Phase 2–7 view (banner + per-element flag) |
| `language` | `zh-CN` \| `zh-TW` \| `en` | Phase 1B (or M.3-Auto for inferred path) | All view rendering |
| `scorecard_type` | `EDDIC` \| `MEDDPICC` | Phase 1B (M.3) or M.3-Auto | M.4, M.6 |
| `customer_name`, `opportunity_name`, `opportunity_location`, `opportunity_type`, `current_stage` | strings | Phase 1B (or Phase 1A-Auto user input for inferred path) | Phases 2–7 |
| `total_score`, `element_scores{}` | numeric / map | Phase 1B (M.5, M.6) or M.3-Auto | Phases 2–6 |
| `alignment_result` | `Aligned` \| `Aligned — Strengthening Recommended` \| `Rollback Recommended` \| `Advancement Ready` | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phases 3, 6, 7 |
| `rollback_recommended` | bool | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phases 3–7 (banner trigger) |
| `rollback_target` | stage name \| null | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phase 3 narrative; Phase 7 banner |
| `rollback_reasons` | list of strings | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phase 3 narrative; Phase 7 banner |
| `progression_gate_passed` | bool \| null | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phase 2 deal-assessment card; Phase 7 |
| `progression_gate_target` | stage name \| null | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phase 2 deal-assessment card; Phase 7 |
| `progression_gate_failed_conditions` | list of strings | Phase 2 (M.13) | Phase 2 deal-assessment card; Phase 7 |
| `eb_identity` | job title \| null | Phase 5 (M.18 silent) | Phase 5 question generation |
| `no_persona_mode` | bool | Phase 5 (M.18 silent) | Phase 5 (degraded mode) |
| `phase7_path` | `A` \| `B` | Phase 7 entry | Phase 7 confirmation message |
| `phases_completed` | set of phase ids | each phase end | Phase 7 (which sections to render) |

## C.0.1 Global Interrupts

Recognized at any point; override Phase Gating. Setting these flags or running these branches does NOT alter `phases_completed`.

| Trigger phrases | Action |
|---|---|
| "show the data" / "show parse details" / "显示明细" / similar | Render **view:phase1b.full-extraction-dump** with current Model state. Resume previous phase after. |
| "生成报告" / "导出报告" / "生成阅读界面" / "出一份报告" / "打包成 HTML" / "给我一份 HTML" / "做成可分享的报告" / "report" / "export report" / "generate report" / "export HTML" / "reading view" / "shareable report" | Set `phase7_path = B` and jump to Phase 7 with whatever Phase 2–6 outputs are in context. |
| "导出 PDF" / "export to PDF" / "打印版" (only after Phase 7 HTML produced) | Invoke PDF export — see Phase 7 Step 4. |
| "导出 Word" / "export to docx" / "Word 版" (only after Phase 7 HTML produced) | Invoke Word export — see Phase 7 Step 4. |

## C.1 Phase Gating Rule (HARD)

After completing each phase, Control MUST pause and wait for explicit user confirmation ("continue" / "proceed" / "下一步" / "go") before starting the next phase. NEVER chain phases in one response.

Exceptions:
- Phase 1B → Phase 2: silent handoff in the same turn when no exception fires.
- Phase 2 → Phase 3: standard gating (confirm to proceed).

If the user asks a clarifying question, answer it and re-prompt for confirmation.

## C.2 Phase Sequence

`Phase 1 → 1A → [1B | 1A-Auto] → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7`

Branches:
- Phase 1 = Commodity → exit (no further phases).
- Phase 1A Option A/B → Phase 1B (Scorecard parsing).
- Phase 1A Option C → Phase 1A-Auto (inference) → Phase 2 (skipping Phase 1B since inference replaces parsing).
- Phase 7 also enterable any time after Phase 2 via Path B (see C.0.1).

Phase 2 is the merged "Deal Assessment + Stage Alignment" verdict (formerly Phase 2 + Phase 2.5). It produces a single status verdict per opportunity. The Model layer still computes health, alignment, stakeholder gate, exit-criteria gate, and progression gate as separate nodes (M.9 / M.12 / M.13) — but the View renders one consolidated card.

## C.3 Phases

---

### Phase 1 — Opportunity Classification

**Purpose:** Lock the opportunity tier (Commodity / Simple / Strategic) before any Scorecard work. User self-classifies — no agent inference.

**Steps:**

1. Render **view:phase1.classification-matrix**.
2. WAIT for user pick.
3. Branch on user response:
   - `Commodity` → set `tier = Commodity` → render **view:phase1.upgrade-signal-checklist** → EXIT skill.
   - `Simple` → set `tier = Simple` → proceed to Phase 1A.
   - `Strategic` → set `tier = Strategic` → proceed to Phase 1A.

**Hard constraints (enforced by Model — see M.2):**
- Never downgrade Strategic → Simple.
- Upgrades always allowed (Commodity → Simple → Strategic).
- When unsure between two tiers, pick the higher one.

**Gating:** Phase 1 ends at user classification choice. Commodity → exit skill. Simple/Strategic → Phase 1A (Scorecard Source Selection).

---

### Phase 1A — Scorecard Source Selection

**Purpose:** Let the user choose how to obtain the Scorecard data needed for downstream analysis. Three paths: upload existing, fill out the form, or let the agent auto-infer from other Dali skill outputs already in session context.

**Trigger:** Phase 1 confirmed `tier ∈ {Simple, Strategic}`.

**Steps:**

1. Render **view:phase1a.scorecard-source-prompt** (three options + tier-appropriate form link).
2. WAIT for user pick.
3. Branch on user response:
   - **Option A "我有 Scorecard"** → ask user to upload .xlsx → Phase 1B (existing flow, `scorecard_source = "upload"`).
   - **Option B "我没有，让我填一下"** → render tier-appropriate form-fill instruction (`assets/eddic-scorecard-form.html` / `assets/scorecard-form.html`) → WAIT for .xlsx upload → Phase 1B (`scorecard_source = "form"`).
   - **Option C "让 Agent 用现有信息推断"** → proceed to Phase 1A-Auto (`scorecard_source = "auto-inferred"`).

**Hard constraints:**
- Path C makes downstream analysis less precise. Every option must be presented with the same "more precise data → better analysis" framing — but Option C is a legitimate path, not a failure mode.
- Path C requires that at least one Dali skill output is available in the session context. If the user picks Option C with no upstream skill outputs, render a fallback message: "我手头没有其他 skill 的信息，自动推断会几乎全空白；建议改选 A 或 B" → re-prompt.

**Gating:** Phase 1A ends at the user's choice + downstream entry condition (uploaded file for A/B, sufficient context for C).

---

### Phase 1A-Auto — Scorecard Auto-Inference (only when Option C selected)

**Purpose:** Use already-available context (Dali agent's conversation memory + user-confirmed mapping) plus user-provided opportunity basics to produce an inferred Scorecard. The user reviews and confirms (or modifies) before proceeding. **Critical:** opportunity-progression does NOT actively invoke other skills here — it reads what's already present in conversation context.

**Trigger:** Phase 1A `scorecard_source = "auto-inferred"`.

**Steps:**

1. Render **view:phase1a-auto.collect-basics-prompt** asking for the 4 mandatory items:
   - Customer name (required)
   - Opportunity name (required)
   - Current stage (required — Prospect / Qualified / Tech Validation / Business Validation / Committed / Closed Launched)
   - Brief opportunity description (optional, helps inference)

2. WAIT for user reply. Parse into Tier 1 inputs.

3. **Context relevance check (HARD — prevents using wrong customer's data):**
   - Render **view:phase1a-auto.context-relevance-prompt** showing all skill outputs visible in the current Dali conversation (e.g., "本会话中我看到这些 skill 输出：account-context, contact-profiling, bttroc...").
   - For each visible skill output, ask the user: "这个 skill 输出是为 [customer_name] / [opportunity_name] 跑的吗？" with three options:
     - `confirmed_current` — yes, same customer + same opportunity
     - `assumed_current` — same customer but different opportunity, or unsure
     - `unrelated` — different customer entirely, ignore this output
   - WAIT for user response.

   **User input parsing (HARD — disambiguate shorthand replies):**
   - **Bulk shorthand**: `全 confirmed` / `all confirmed` / `都是的` / `全部是` → all listed skills marked `confirmed_current`.
   - **Bulk negative**: `全 unrelated` / `all unrelated` / `都不是` / `全是别的` → all listed skills marked `unrelated` → fallback to no-context-warning (see Step 4 fallback).
   - **Bulk assumed**: `全 assumed` / `不太确定` → all listed skills marked `assumed_current` (caps confidence at med).
   - **Partial listing** (user replies with only some skills): listed skills get user's tag; **unlisted skills default to `unrelated`** (safer — unmentioned outputs are excluded rather than assumed). Render a one-line confirmation showing the resolved map before proceeding.
   - **Ambiguous reply** (e.g., `差不多 / 应该是 / 大致 OK`): re-prompt once with the explicit format. Second ambiguous reply → default all to `unrelated` and proceed to fallback warning.
   - **Skill name without relevance label** (e.g., user says "我跑过 account-context"): re-prompt asking specifically for that skill's relevance.
   - **Default-on-skip principle**: any uncertainty defaults to `unrelated`. The cost of using wrong customer's data > the cost of a slightly weaker inference.

   - Build the relevance map (Tier 2 input). If the resolved map has zero `confirmed_current` AND zero `assumed_current`, branch to Step 4 fallback (see below).

4. Call **M.3-Auto Scorecard Inference**:
   - Inputs: Tier 1 (user basics), Tier 2 (relevance map), Tier 3 (conversation context, filtered by Tier 2), Tier 4 (`tier`).
   - Outputs: `inferred_statements`, `element_scores`, `total_score`, `inference_confidence`, `context_used`.

   **Step 4 fallback (no usable context):** if Tier 2 yields no `confirmed_current` or `assumed_current` skills, render **view:phase1a-auto.no-context-warning** and WAIT. User can:
   - Reply `A` → exit Phase 1A-Auto, redirect to Phase 1A Option A (upload existing Scorecard).
   - Reply `B` → exit Phase 1A-Auto, redirect to Phase 1A Option B (form fill).
   - Reply `继续` / `proceed anyway` → run M.3-Auto with empty Tier 3, expect mostly `default_no` outputs, proceed to Step 5.

5. Render **view:phase1a-auto.review-card**:
   - Show 8 (Strategic) or 5 (Simple) elements with inferred scores.
   - For each statement: show the Yes/No inference, the source citation (with source_tier + source_relevance), and confidence band.
   - Show overall inference confidence + breakdown:
     - "X 条由 Tier 1 (你的描述) 提供"
     - "Y 条由 Tier 3 confirmed_current skill 提供"
     - "Z 条由 Tier 3 assumed_current skill 提供 (信心 capped at 中)"
     - "W 条因无足够信息默认为 No"

6. WAIT for user response. Four sub-paths:
   - **"全部接受"** → set `scorecard_source = "auto-inferred-accepted"` → proceed to Phase 2.
   - **"修改 [list of statements]"** → for each statement: render edit prompt; user provides new Yes/No; re-compute element scores; re-render review card; re-WAIT.
   - **"修改 context 关联"** / `修改 context` / `重新标 skill 关联性` → discard the inferred Scorecard; jump back to Step 3, re-render the context-relevance-prompt (preserving Tier 1 user basics), let user re-mark skills' relevance; re-run M.3-Auto with new Tier 2 map; re-render review card.
   - **"我自己填表单"** → discard inference, redirect to Phase 1A Option B.

7. After acceptance: set Session State flags `scorecard_source = "auto-inferred-accepted"`, `inference_confidence`, `context_used`. Skip M.3, M.4, M.5, M.6 (already covered by M.3-Auto). Proceed to Phase 2.

**Hard constraints:**
- **Never invent contact names or specific customer commitments** (per M.3-Auto rule 3).
- **Never use training-data inference** to fill gaps. If a Yes inference would require general MEDDPICC knowledge or industry conventions, default to No + `confidence = low`.
- Every statement carries `source_tier` + `source_relevance` per M.0 attribution rule.
- A standing warning banner is added to all Phase 2–7 outputs (V.0.7 — Inferred Scorecard Banner) and the Phase 7 report header.
- If Tier 3 has no skill outputs for the current customer/opportunity (all `unrelated` or none visible), warn the user that inference will be very weak (mostly default No) and offer to switch to Option B.

**Gating:** Phase 1A-Auto ends at user "全部接受" → Phase 2 (skipping Phase 1B since inference replaces parsing).

---

### Phase 1B — Scorecard Upload & Data Extraction

**Purpose:** Parse uploaded Scorecard, validate tier match, populate Session State. Default behavior is **silent handoff to Phase 2** — only break silence on exceptions.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.3 Scorecard Parser**.
   - Parse error → render **view:phase1b.parse-error** → STOP.
2. Call **M.4 Tier Match Validation**.
   - Mismatch → render **view:phase1b.tier-mismatch-prompt** → WAIT.
   - Apply user resolution per M.4 (downgrade / re-upload / proceed with restricted scope).
3. Call **M.5 Element Score Computation** + **M.6 Total Score Computation**.
   - Consistency anomaly → render **view:phase1b.consistency-anomaly** → WAIT.
4. Call **M.7 Role Terminology Normalization** (silent — inline correction in downstream output).
5. Call **M.8 Competitive Info Extraction**.
6. Default exit: render **view:phase1b.silent-handoff** (one line) and immediately deliver Phase 2 in the same turn.
7. On-demand (handled by C.0.1 Global Interrupt): render **view:phase1b.full-extraction-dump** at any time.

**Gating:** No user pause unless an exception fires. Phase 2 follows in the same response.

---

### Phase 2 — Deal Assessment

**Purpose:** Single consolidated status verdict — score, primary blocker, stage alignment (rollback / advancement), progression gate, immediate action, 30-day targets. One card, sales-readable, no internal gate terminology.

**Computation Dependency (HARD):** Before rendering, pre-run all shared Model calculations:
- **M.11 Stage Aggregation** [shared] — required for verdict logic and Phase 3 reuse.
- **M.14 Element Relationship Status** [shared] — required for Primary Blocker selection.
- **M.12 Stage Alignment** + **M.13 Alignment Flags** — produce verdict, rollback target, progression gate result.

Pre-runs are silent. Full diagnostics from M.11 / M.14 belong to Phase 3 / Phase 5; do not surface them in Phase 2.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.9 Deal Health Logic**.
2. Call **M.10 30-Day Targets Generation**.
3. Call **M.12 Stage Alignment** (Stakeholder Gate + Exit Criteria Gate + Stage Progression Gate). Model-internal terminology — view layer renders consolidated verdict, never gate names.
4. Call **M.13 Alignment Flags** to set `alignment_result`, `rollback_recommended`, `rollback_target`, `rollback_reasons`, `progression_gate_passed`, `progression_gate_target`, `progression_gate_failed_conditions`.
5. Render **view:phase2.deal-assessment-card** as a single consolidated card.

**Gating:**
- `alignment_result = Aligned` AND `progression_gate_passed ∈ {true, null}` → no special prompt; standard "确认进入 Phase 3" gating.
- All other branches → render the inline acknowledgment line at the end of the card per **view:phase2.deal-assessment-card** rules → standard "确认进入 Phase 3" gating.

Phase 2 does NOT require user "accept/decline" of any verdict — the result is advisory; the analyst weighs it.

---

### Phase 3 — Sales Stage Assessment

**Purpose:** Per-criterion evaluation of exit criteria from Prospect through current stage; aggregate per stage; surface risk buckets. Inherits `alignment_result` and `rollback_recommended` from Phase 2 to drive the standing banner; does NOT recompute stage-alignment verdict.

**Standing Banner:** If `rollback_recommended = true`, prepend **view:shared.warning-banner**.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.15 Exit Criteria Evaluation** (per-row status + lowest-status precedence aggregation).
2. Call **M.11 Stage Aggregation** [shared — already cached from Phase 2 pre-run].
3. Render **view:phase3.exit-criteria-table** + **view:phase3.stage-aggregation**.
4. Render **view:phase3.stage-progression-recommendation** based on `alignment_result`.
5. Call **M.16 Risk Bucketing**.
6. Render **view:phase3.risk-buckets**.

**Gating:** Phase Gating — confirm to proceed to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4 — Market & Competitive Intelligence

**Purpose:** Consume outputs from delegated skills (`account-context`, `solutions-search`, `competitive-intelligence`). This skill performs no web search; no integration commentary; cross-referencing to MEDDPICC scores belongs to Phase 5 Layer B.

**Standing Banner:** If `rollback_recommended = true`, prepend **view:shared.warning-banner**.

**Steps:**

1. Call **`account-context`** + **`solutions-search`** skills with Customer Name, Opportunity Name, Opportunity Type, Opportunity Location.
2. Render **view:phase4.market-search** (3 fixed sections: Customer Stack / Industry Buying Behavior / Same-Industry References).
3. Branch on tier and Competitive Info:
   - Strategic → always call **`competitive-intelligence`** skill.
   - Simple AND Competitive Info has at least one named competitor → call **`competitive-intelligence`**.
   - Simple AND no named competitor → record "No named competitors — competitive monitoring not triggered at Simple tier" and skip the Compete block.
4. Render **view:phase4.compete-block** (when applicable).
5. Render **view:phase4.provenance-note**.

**Hard rules:**
- Consume delegated outputs as given. Never substitute web search or training-data speculation when delegated output is thin — surface the gap.
- No integration commentary. Cross-referencing to MEDDPICC scores belongs to Phase 5 Layer B.

**Gating:** Phase Gating — confirm to proceed to Phase 5.

---

### Phase 5 — Element Gap Analysis & Customer Verification Questions

**Purpose:** Two-layer element diagnostic, stakeholder profiling, persona-tuned verification questions.

**Standing Banner:** If `rollback_recommended = true`, prepend **view:shared.warning-banner**.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.17 Element Diagnostic** (Layer A priorities P0/P1/P2 + Layer B Diagnostic Evidence triggers).
2. Render **view:phase5.layer-a-table** + **view:phase5.layer-b-cards** (B cards skip P2).
3. Call **M.18 EB Identity Resolution** **silently**:
   - EB title found in Scorecard or prior user input → set `eb_identity`, `no_persona_mode = false`.
   - Neither source available → set `eb_identity = null`, `no_persona_mode = true`. Do NOT render any prompt; do NOT pause; do NOT request user input. Proceed to next step.
4. Call **`contact-profiling`** skill (with fallback if unavailable). If `eb_identity` is C-level, also call **`cxo-personas`** skill (use its `references/INDEX.md` Title Mapping to load the matching persona). When `no_persona_mode = true`, skip both skill calls.
5. Render **view:phase5.stakeholder-profiling** with source status declared.
6. Call **M.19 Question Generation** (hard cap 12 main questions; per-priority budgets 2–3/2/skip; de-duplication).
7. Render **view:phase5.persona-traits-applied** (skipped if `no_persona_mode = true`) + **view:phase5.verification-questions**.

**Gating:** Phase Gating — confirm to proceed to Phase 6.

---

### Phase 6 — Action Plan

**Purpose:** Translate Phase 2–5 analysis into Winning Strategies (L2) and Weekly Plan (L3). Tight 1:1 mapping to Phase 2's 30-day targets enforced by **M.20**.

**Standing Banner:** If `rollback_recommended = true`, prepend **view:shared.warning-banner**.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.20 Phase 2-6 Consistency Rules** to compute Strategy list (1:1 with Phase 2 targets, ≤3) and bind Strategy 1 to Primary Blocker.
2. Call **M.21 Weekly Horizon Logic** to set horizon (default 4 weeks; 6–8 weeks if rollback + current-stage aggregate <30%).
3. Render **view:phase6.action-plan**.

**Gating:** Prompt user to confirm proceeding to Phase 7 Reading Report Generation. → WAIT.

---

### Phase 7 — Reading Report Generation

**Purpose:** Package Phase 2–6 analysis into a Jinja2-rendered HTML report. **No new analysis** — every field traces to a prior phase output.

**Entry paths:**
- **Path A** — natural handoff after Phase 6. Set `phase7_path = A`.
- **Path B** — Global Interrupt fires from C.0.1. Set `phase7_path = B`. Use whatever phases ran; render only their data keys.

**Steps:**

1. Call **M.22 Report Data Dict Assembly** to build the structured data dict per `examples/sample-data.json` contract.
2. Render **view:phase7.save-path-prompt** → WAIT for path.
3. Call **M.23 File Naming & Collision** to compute final file path.
4. Render the Jinja2 template `templates/opportunity-progression.html.j2` with the data dict (see **V.HTML.0**). Write the HTML file.
5. **Persist data dict alongside HTML:** write the same data dict to `[save-path]/[slug]-data.json` (same slug as the HTML, same collision-handling rule via M.23). Required for later Word export when context has been compacted.
6. **Persist Model snapshot (machine-readable):** call **M.24 Model Snapshot Persistence** to write a complete Model-layer snapshot to `~/.dali/opportunity-progression/snapshots/{customer}__{opportunity}__{timestamp}.json`. This is independent of the user-facing report path; the file is for downstream machine consumption (re-run reuse / diff / external handoff). User does not see the file by default; it MAY be referenced as a one-line footnote in Step 7's delivery confirmation.
7. Render **view:phase7.delivery-confirmation**.
8. **Optional exports** — handled by C.0.1 Global Interrupt:
   - PDF: invoke `examples/export_pdf.py` (Playwright — see **V.PDF.0**).
   - Word: invoke `examples/export_docx.py` (python-docx, reads the persisted JSON sidecar from Step 5 — see **V.DOCX.0**).

**Hard constraints:**
- No new analysis. Missing fields render as "Not available", never invented content.
- Schema sync: see V.DOCX.0 schema sync rule.
- MD3 palette and typography are fixed.
- No file paths, agent traces, or raw JSON in rendered HTML.

**Gating:** Skill session ends after Phase 7 confirmation, unless user requests PDF / Word.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROCEDURE 2 — MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Nodes tagged `[shared: phase X, phase Y]` compute once per session and are reused. Control's pre-run notes trigger early so downstream phases reuse the cached value.

## M.0 Data Attribution Rule

Every value Model produces carries a `source` field. View renders source alongside value (V.0.1).

`source` types:
- **Scorecard cell** — sheet / row / column / field. Example: `{score: 13, source: "Scorecard / MEDDPICC / row 12 / E final statement / weight 5"}`.
- **Computed from Model node** — name producing node. Example: `{value: 67, source: "M.5 (E score 13) / M.5 (E max 13)"}`.
- **Reserved interface** — interface name + connection status.
- **Tagged inference** — `⚠️ Industry/role-based inference, not from Scorecard or connected interfaces`.

Aggregating nodes propagate input sources into output. Never describe an element as "low/high/strong/weak" without its actual percentage and source.

## M.1 Constants

### M.1.1 Tier Scope Table

| Tier | In-Scope Elements | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Commodity | — | Skill exits at Phase 1 |
| Simple (EDDIC) | I, E, DC, DP, CP | M, P, CH not assessed |
| Strategic (MEDDPICC) | M, E, DC, DP, P, I, CH, CP | All 8 elements |

### M.1.2 MEDDPICC V3 Element Weights

Reference weights, used only when cell formulas are unreadable. If formulas are present, trust the formulas.

| Element | Per-statement weights | Element max |
|---|---|---|
| I | 4 / 4 / 4 | 12 |
| M | 3 / 1 / 4 / 5 | 13 |
| E | 4 / 4 / 5 | 13 |
| CH | 4 / 4 / 4 | 12 |
| CP | 4 / 4 / 4 | 12 |
| DC | 3 / 3 / 3 / 4 | 13 |
| DP | 4 / 4 / 5 | 13 |
| P | 4 / 4 / 4 | 12 |
| **MEDDPICC total** | | **100** |
| **EDDIC total** (I + E + DC + DP + CP) | | **63** |

### M.1.3 Stage → Element Mapping

Source: `assets/aws-sales-stages.md`. Use **MEDDPICC Stage Mapping** when `tier = Strategic`, **EDDIC Stage Mapping** when `tier = Simple`. Granularity: one element per row; multi-element exit criteria → multi-row.

### M.1.4 Element Relationship Matrix

Source: `assets/meddpicc-framework.md`. Use **MEDDPICC Element Relationship Matrix** when `tier = Strategic`, **EDDIC Element Relationship Matrix** when `tier = Simple`. The matrix is **symmetric and undirected** — it lists which elements share content scope, not which element causes or precedes another. Used by M.14 to populate the Layer A "关联状态 / Relationship" column.

### M.1.5 Classification Hard Constraints

- Never downgrade Strategic → Simple.
- Upgrades always allowed (Commodity → Simple → Strategic), one-way.
- When unsure between two adjacent tiers, pick the higher one.

### M.1.6 Symbol Vocabulary

| Symbol | Meaning | Where used |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | On Track / Aligned / OK | Status, alignment, metric verification |
| ⚠️ | Caution / not-corroborated / not-connected / inferred | Risk flag, interface status, inference tag, 100%-with-fragile-related-element flag |
| 🔴 | Blocking / At Risk | Exit-criterion status, At Risk priority |
| 🚀 | Ready for advancement | Phase 2 Advancement Ready |
| ℹ️ | Informational / strengthening recommended | Phase 2 Aligned — Strengthening Recommended |
| — | No related elements with material score gap | Layer A Relationship column when N/A |

In Layer A, `⚠️` against a 100% element means the element is at its score ceiling but at least one related element is below 80% — i.e., the score is not corroborated by related-element strength. Single source of truth for symbols.

| `ALIGNMENT_PASS1_QUAL_STAKEHOLDER_STRATEGIC` | EB% + Champion% < 100% (Qualified, Strategic) | M.12 |
| `ALIGNMENT_PASS1_QUAL_STAKEHOLDER_SIMPLE` | EB% < 100% (Qualified, Simple) | M.12 |
| `PROGRESSION_GATE_TV_BV_TOTAL` | 65 | M.12 (rows 1 & 2 of Stage Progression Gates — Total Score min) |

| `QUESTION_BUDGET_P1` | P1 (60% ≤ score < 80%): 2 main + 1 follow-up each | M.19 |
| `QUESTION_BUDGET_P2` | P2 (≥ 80%): skipped (monitoring only) | M.19 |
| `WEEKLY_HORIZON_DEFAULT` | 4 weeks | M.21 |
| `WEEKLY_HORIZON_EXTENDED` | 6–8 weeks (when rollback + current-stage aggregate < 30%) | M.21 |
| `WEEKLY_HORIZON_EXTEND_TRIGGER` | rollback_recommended AND current-stage aggregate < 30% | M.21 |
| `ACTION_DESCRIPTION_MAX_CHARS` | 100 chars per W-action | M.20 / V phase 6 |

## M.3 Scorecard Parser

**Inputs:** uploaded `.xlsx` file, `tier` from Phase 1.

**Outputs:** raw extracted data, `language` (auto-detected), `scorecard_type` ∈ {`EDDIC`, `MEDDPICC`}, parse status.

**Rules:**
- Required sheets: opportunity basic info sheet + at least one scoring sheet. Missing → parse error.
- Auto-detect which scoring sheet has real (non-default) scores.
- For paired pre/post columns (课前/课后, Pre-Class/After-Class): use the **课后 / After-Class / Post** column as the single source of truth for all scoring. Pre-class data is NOT retained for downstream analysis (including Phase 5 Diagnostic Evidence). If only one column exists, use it.
- Auto-detect `language`:
  - TC sheet → `zh-TW`
  - SC sheet → `zh-CN`
  - English sheet → `en`
- Auto-detect `scorecard_type` from the Basic Info sheet's Total Score cell:
  - Cell label contains "EDDIC" or denominator is `/63` → `EDDIC`
  - Denominator is `/100` (with no EDDIC marker) → `MEDDPICC`
  - Ambiguous → fall back to inspecting which scoring sheets carry data; an EDDIC Scorecard's scoring sheets cover only I / E / DC / DP / CP statements; a MEDDPICC sheet covers all 8.
- Format invalid → return parse error with message `"The file format does not meet requirements. Please use the latest Scorecard template for your tier."` (rendered by V).

## M.3-Auto Scorecard Inference

**Purpose:** When the user picks Phase 1A Option C, generate inferred Scorecard answers from already-available context in the current Dali session. Replaces M.3 / M.5 / M.6 for the inferred path.

**Critical scope distinction (HARD):** opportunity-progression does NOT actively invoke other Dali skills here. M.3-Auto reads only what is already present in the Dali agent's conversation context — i.e., outputs from skills the user happened to run earlier in the same session. If a relevant skill never ran, its data is simply absent — M.3-Auto defaults the corresponding statements to `No` with confidence `low` rather than triggering a skill call.

**Inputs (4 strict tiers, in priority order):**

1. **Tier 1 — User-provided opportunity basics** (from Phase 1A-Auto Step 1, mandatory):
   - `customer_name`
   - `opportunity_name`
   - `current_stage`
   - `opportunity_description` (optional, free-form, helps inference)

2. **Tier 2 — User-confirmed context relevance** (from Phase 1A-Auto Step 2, mandatory):
   - List of Dali skills the user explicitly confirms ran earlier in this session AND were for this same customer / opportunity.
   - Each entry: `{skill_name, customer_in_skill, opportunity_in_skill, relevance ∈ {confirmed_current | assumed_current | unrelated}}`.

3. **Tier 3 — Conversation context** (Dali agent's session memory):
   - Whatever skill outputs are visible to the LLM from earlier in this conversation. Examples: `account-context`, `contact-profiling`, `bttroc`, `engagement-plan`, `post-meeting-report`, `business-insight`, `competitive-intelligence`, `solutions-search`.
   - These are NOT actively invoked. M.3-Auto reads what's already in context.
   - Each output is filtered through the Tier 2 relevance map: only `confirmed_current` outputs are used as positive evidence; `assumed_current` are used with `confidence` capped at `med`; `unrelated` outputs are ignored.

4. **Tier 4 — `tier` from Phase 1** (governs in-scope element list).

**Phase 4 delegated skills are NOT inputs here.** Phase 4 happens after Phase 2; M.3-Auto runs at Phase 1A. Any data those skills would provide is excluded.

**Outputs:**
- `inferred_statements` — for each in-scope element, for each statement: `{statement_text, inferred_answer ∈ {Yes, No, Unknown}, source, source_tier ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, source_relevance ∈ {confirmed_current, assumed_current, user_input, default_no}, confidence ∈ {high, med, low}}`
- `element_scores` — derived from inferred statements using same per-statement weights as M.5 (M.1.2 reference table)
- `total_score`, `total_max`, `total_percent` — derived same as M.6
- `inference_confidence` — `{overall: low|med|high, per_element: map, statement_count_by_tier: {tier_1, tier_2, tier_3_confirmed, tier_3_assumed, default_no}}`
- `context_used` — list of skill names actually contributing positive evidence (for snapshot audit)
- `language` — defaulted to `zh-CN` unless user input clearly indicates otherwise
- `scorecard_type` — derived from `tier`: Strategic → MEDDPICC, Simple → EDDIC

**Inference rules (HARD — no fabrication):**

1. **Evidence-first, not training-data-first.** For each MEDDPICC / EDDIC statement, the inference engine asks: "is there explicit evidence in the available inputs (Tier 1-3) that supports a Yes answer?"
   - **Strong evidence** (e.g., post-meeting-report quote, named contact in contact-profiling) → `inferred_answer = Yes`, `confidence = high`.
   - **Indirect support** (e.g., role inferred from org chart but no contact record) → `inferred_answer = No`, `confidence = med`, source explicitly notes the gap.
   - **No evidence** → `inferred_answer = No` (default), `confidence = low`, source = `"无足够信息推断"`.
   - **Training-data inference is FORBIDDEN.** Do NOT use general MEDDPICC knowledge or industry conventions to fill gaps. The output must be defensible against a "where did you get this from" challenge.

2. **Tier-aware confidence cap:**
   - `Tier 3 with relevance = confirmed_current` → can produce `confidence = high`.
   - `Tier 3 with relevance = assumed_current` → confidence capped at `med` (because customer/opportunity match is assumed but not confirmed).
   - `Tier 3 with relevance = unrelated` → ignored entirely (does not contribute to any inference).
   - `Tier 1 user input` → can produce `confidence = high` for descriptive statements, `med` for evaluative ones.
   - `Tier 4 (tier alone)` → never enough for a Yes inference.

3. **Never assert specific named facts the inputs don't contain.** No invented Champion names, no invented commitments, no fabricated metric values. If a statement requires asserting "Champion is named X" without a source, default to `No` + `confidence = low` + source `"无相关 contact 记录"`.

4. **Source attribution per V.0.1.** Every statement carries:
   - `source` — naming the originating input (e.g., `"contact-profiling output (confirmed current): contact 'David' has influence_score = 4"`, `"user opportunity description"`, `"无足够信息推断"`)
   - `source_tier` — which Tier the evidence came from
   - `source_relevance` — confirmed/assumed/user_input/default_no

5. **Per-element confidence rollup:**
   - All statements `high` → element `high`.
   - Any statement `low` → element `low`.
   - Otherwise → element `med`.

6. **Overall confidence:**
   - All elements `high` → overall `high`.
   - All elements ≥ `med` → overall `med`.
   - Any element `low` → overall `low`.

**Standing flag:** writes `inference_confidence` and `context_used` to Session State; subsequent phases render the V.0.7 banner.

**Audit / re-run:** the full `inferred_statements` array (with per-statement source / source_tier / source_relevance / confidence) is persisted in M.24 Model snapshot (sub-key `M.3-Auto.inferred_statements`).

## M.4 Tier Match Validation

**Inputs:** `tier` (from Phase 1), `scorecard_type` (from M.3).

**Outputs:** match status, optional user-resolution outcome.

**Rules:**

| Phase 1 `tier` | `scorecard_type` | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Simple | EDDIC | Matched → proceed |
| Strategic | MEDDPICC | Matched → proceed |
| Simple | MEDDPICC | Mismatch (lenient) → render prompt; on user confirm, proceed with EDDIC scope only (M/P/CH ignored). No re-upload required. M.6 falls back to manual computation per its rule table. |
| Strategic | EDDIC | Mismatch (strict) → render prompt with two options: (A) downgrade `tier` to Simple, proceed with EDDIC; (B) request fresh MEDDPICC upload, re-run M.3. WAIT for user choice. |

## M.5 Element Score Computation

**Inputs:** parsed Scorecard sheet, `tier`.

**Outputs:** for each in-scope element: `{score, max, percent, source}`.

**Rules:**
- Each row in the scoring sheet = one evaluation statement with: Category, Element, Statement, Applies (Yes/No), Score (numeric).
- Per-statement maximum is **NOT fixed at 5**. Read weight from the cell formula (e.g., `IF(E7="Yes",4,0)` → weight = 4). Weights vary 1–5 across statements.
- For each in-scope element (per M.1.1):
  1. For each statement: read weight from formula; if cell has a plain numeric score, weight equals that number when answer = Yes; infer from M.1.2 weights if ambiguous.
  2. `Element Score = Σ (weight | answer = Yes)`
  3. `Element Max = Σ (all statement weights)`
  4. `Element % = Element Score / Element Max × 100`
- If formulas unreadable AND M.1.2 reference weights cannot be applied → flag to user (parse error).

**Non-scope data retention (Simple tier only):** if Scorecard contains M / P / CH despite Simple classification:
- Retain raw values in Session State as `out_of_scope_elements{}` for Phase 5 / Phase 6 narrative use.
- Do NOT include in Total Score (M.6) or per-element analysis (M.17).
- Phase 2 footer line is rendered (see V phase 2 footer rule).

## M.6 Total Score Computation

**Inputs:** element scores from M.5, `tier`, `scorecard_type` from M.3, Basic Info Score-After cell.

**Outputs:** `{total_score, total_max, total_percent, source}`.

**Rules — source of truth selected by (Scorecard type, Tier):**

| Scorecard type | Tier | Total Score source | Display |
|---|---|---|---|
| MEDDPICC | Strategic | Basic Info `Score-After (/100)` cell | `[Score]/100` |
| EDDIC | Simple | Basic Info `EDDIC Score-After (/63)` cell | `EDDIC [Score]/63 = [Z]%` |
| MEDDPICC | Simple (after lenient downgrade in M.4) | Computed: `score_I + score_E + score_DC + score_DP + score_CP`; max = sum of those 5 element max | `EDDIC [Score]/63 = [Z]%`. Append `(ref: MEDDPICC Basic Info = [W]/100 — EDDIC analysis does not use this)` in italics. |
| EDDIC | Strategic | n/a — blocked by M.4 strict mismatch path | n/a |

**Consistency anomaly:** set `consistency_anomaly = true` and surface to V if any of:
- Required fields (Stage, Total Score, element scores) are missing or unreadable.
- For MEDDPICC + Strategic: Basic Info Score-After does not reconcile with per-element sum (rounding tolerance).
- For EDDIC + Simple: `EDDIC Score-After (/63)` cell value ≠ `score_I + score_E + score_DC + score_DP + score_CP`.

## M.7 Role Terminology Normalization

**Rules — column-level role labels (Scorecard headers, structured fields):**
- Map "Sponsor" / "Stakeholder" / "Supporter" → MEDDPICC role framework. Only **Economic Buyer (EB)** and **Champion** are key MEDDPICC roles; everyone else is a **Coach**.
- "CO" (legacy abbreviation for Competition) → treat as synonym of **CP**. Emit CP in all downstream output regardless of input label.

**Rules — free-text role mentions (Remarks, Notes, 备注 columns, Sheet1 free-form fields):**

When parsing free-text fields anywhere in the Scorecard, scan for non-MEDDPICC role nouns ("supporter" / "sponsor" / "stakeholder" / "支持者" / "赞助者" / "联络人" used as role labels) and produce a **normalization record** for downstream phases:

```
{
  raw_label: "supporter",
  raw_text: "确认了 supporter 是 David",
  contact_name: "David",                          # extracted name if present
  meddpicc_classification: "Coach" | "Champion candidate" | null,
  classification_basis: text explaining the reasoning
}
```

**Classification logic (HARD):**

1. Default classification → `Coach` (the safe assumption — anyone identified by the customer as "supportive" is at minimum a Coach).
2. Upgrade to `Champion candidate` only if **all** of the following hold:
   - Champion element ≥ 60% (Strategic tier) AND
   - The Champion-element first statement ("Champion has power and influence") = Yes AND
   - The Champion-element second statement ("Champion provides valuable intel") = Yes
3. **Never** classify a Remarks-mentioned contact as `Champion` outright — Champion-the-role requires verification beyond a single Remarks reference. Even when both gating statements are Yes, the label is `Champion candidate` until Phase 5 root-cause analysis confirms.

**Downstream rendering rules (apply uniformly across Phase 5 / Phase 6 / Phase 7):**

- Never emit "Supporter" / "Sponsor" / "Stakeholder" as a role label in user-facing output. Substitute with the `meddpicc_classification` value (`Coach` or `Champion candidate`).
- When citing the source quote (e.g., in Layer B Diagnostic Evidence), retain the original word in the quote — but immediately follow with `({contact_name} 按 MEDDPICC 框架归类为 {meddpicc_classification}: {classification_basis})`.
- Stakeholder Profiling tables list contacts under their MEDDPICC classification column, not the raw label.
- Remarks-mentioned contacts whose Champion element scores indicate `Coach` are listed in Stakeholder Profiling with a `Coach` tag and a one-line note: "客户口头识别为内部联系人; Champion 元素分 [X]% 未达验证门槛, 当前归类为 Coach".

**Source:** This rule reflects MEDDPICC core role discipline — only EB and Champion are key roles; "Supporter" is not a MEDDPICC concept and must be normalized at parse time.

## M.8 Competitive Info Extraction

**Inputs:** Competitive Info sheet (if present).

**Outputs:**
- Named competitors list
- EB Job Title (used by M.18 EB Identity Resolution)
- Customer Business Objective
- Potential Obstacles
- AWS Solutions

If sheet absent → all fields null; downstream phases handle absence (M.18 silently enters degraded mode for EB; Phase 4 conditional Compete-skill call).

## M.9 Deal Health Logic

**Inputs:** total %, EB %, Champion % (Strategic only), current stage exit-criteria aggregate, prior stage aggregate, `tier`.

**Output:** `health_state ∈ {Foundation Incomplete, Stalled, Off Track, On Plan}` plus gap-fragment strings citing specific elements/aggregates that triggered the state.

**Rules — evaluate in priority order; first match wins:**

1. **Foundation Incomplete:**
   - Generic: current-stage exit criteria < `HEALTH_FOUNDATION_INCOMPLETE_CURRENT` AND prior stage < `HEALTH_FOUNDATION_INCOMPLETE_PRIOR`.
   - Simple-tier-only Prospect threshold: `current_stage = Prospect` AND E = 0%.
2. **Stalled:**
   - Strategic: EB < `HEALTH_STALLED_EB` OR Champion < `HEALTH_STALLED_CHAMPION`.
   - Simple: EB < `HEALTH_STALLED_EB`.
3. **Off Track:** Total % < `HEALTH_OFF_TRACK_TOTAL` (no critical blocker from rules 1–2).
4. **On Plan:**
   - Strategic: Total % ≥ `HEALTH_ON_PLAN_TOTAL` AND EB ≥ `HEALTH_ON_PLAN_EB` AND Champion ≥ `HEALTH_ON_PLAN_CHAMPION`.
   - Simple: Total % ≥ `HEALTH_ON_PLAN_TOTAL` AND EB ≥ `HEALTH_ON_PLAN_EB`.

## M.10 30-Day Targets Generation

**Inputs:** in-scope element scores, current scores below `TARGETS_BELOW_THRESHOLD` (80%).

**Output:** ordered list (≤ `TARGETS_MAX_COUNT`) of `{element, target_percent, source}`.

**Rules:**
- Eligible element: in-scope AND current score < 80%.
- Target value: current + realistic 4-week improvement at `TARGETS_MAX_RATE_PER_WEEK`. Round to threshold breakpoints (60 / 70 / 80) when within reach.
- Order by Priority from M.14 (P0 → P1 → P2) descending; tiebreak by largest gap.
- Cap at 3.

Phase 6 (M.20) consumes this list verbatim — same elements, same thresholds.

## M.11 Stage Aggregation [shared: Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 6]

**Inputs:** Scorecard "Completion %" column from "Opportunity Basic Information" sheet, in-scope criteria per `tier`.

**Output:** for each stage from Prospect through current stage: `{stage, completion_percent, source}`.

**Rules:**
- For each stage: `stage_completion = mean of in-scope exit-criterion Completion % values within that stage`, rounded to nearest integer.
- The Completion % column is authoritative — do NOT recompute from element scores.

Cached after first computation; Phase 3 and Phase 6 reuse.

## M.12 Stage Alignment

**Inputs:** `current_stage`, EB %, Champion %, current-stage aggregate from M.11, `tier`.

**Output:** `{result, rollback_target, rollback_reasons[]}`.

**Rules — three-gate evaluation (Pass 1 ≡ Stakeholder Gate; Pass 2 ≡ Exit Criteria Gate; Pass 3 ≡ Stage Progression Gate. Model-internal terminology — view layer renders gate names only, never "Pass 1 / Pass 2 / Pass 3"):**

**Pass 1 — Stakeholder Gate (only when `current_stage = Qualified`):**
- Strategic: `EB% + Champion% < ALIGNMENT_PASS1_QUAL_STAKEHOLDER_STRATEGIC` (sum < 100) → Pass 1 triggered.
- Simple: `EB% < ALIGNMENT_PASS1_QUAL_STAKEHOLDER_SIMPLE` (< 100) → Pass 1 triggered.
- Pass 1 triggered → `result = Rollback Recommended`, `rollback_target = Prospect`. Continue to Pass 2 to optionally add a second reason.
- Not applicable (stage ≠ Qualified) → skip Pass 1.

**Pass 2 — Exit Criteria Gate (current-stage exit-criteria completeness):**

| Aggregate | Result |
|---|---|
| < `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ROLLBACK` | Rollback Recommended (target via recursive lookup — see below) |
| `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_STRENGTHEN` ≤ aggregate < `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ALIGNED` | Aligned — Strengthening Recommended |
| `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ALIGNED` ≤ aggregate < `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ADVANCEMENT_READY` | Aligned |
| = `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ADVANCEMENT_READY` | Advancement Ready |

**Pass 2 rollback target — recursive lookup:** when Pass 2 triggers Rollback Recommended, do NOT default to the immediately prior stage. Instead, walk **backward through the stage chain** (Tech Validation → Qualified → Prospect; Business Validation → Tech Validation → Qualified → Prospect; etc.) and pick the first stage whose own aggregate ≥ `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ALIGNED` (80%).

```
def find_rollback_target(current_stage):
    for stage in stages_before(current_stage)[::-1]:   # nearest-first
        if M.11_aggregate(stage) >= ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ALIGNED:
            return stage
    return "Prospect"   # 漏斗起点; if even Prospect < 80%, rollback target is Prospect itself
```

Rationale: the immediately prior stage may itself be incomplete, in which case rolling back there is misleading — the opportunity has not actually completed any prior stage. Walk back until finding a stage with substantive completion, or return Prospect as the funnel entry point. The same `ALIGNMENT_PASS2_ALIGNED` threshold (80%) is reused so users see one consistent "completed" bar across the skill.

**Result consolidation:**
- Pass 1 triggered AND Pass 2 triggered → single `Rollback Recommended` citing both reasons. `rollback_target = Prospect` (Pass 1 takes precedence as earlier-stage rollback).
- Pass 1 triggered, Pass 2 not → `Rollback Recommended`, `rollback_target = Prospect`.
- Pass 1 not triggered → use Pass 2 outcome directly (with rollback target from recursive lookup).

**Simple-tier exception:** if `current_stage = Prospect` AND E = 0%, do NOT trigger rollback (Prospect is the starting stage). Handled by M.9 Foundation Incomplete; M.12 returns Pass 2 outcome.

**Pass 3 — Stage Progression Gate (Strategic tier only; reference: `assets/aws-sales-stages.md` "Stage Progression Gates" section):**

Evaluates whether the opportunity, as it stands at `current_stage`, is qualified to advance to the next stage. Always evaluated in addition to Pass 1 and Pass 2; produces a separate boolean `progression_gate_passed` and a `progression_gate_target` (next stage name). At Simple tier, Pass 3 is skipped — set `progression_gate_passed = null`, `progression_gate_target = null`.

| `current_stage` | Target stage | Required conditions (all must be satisfied) |
|---|---|---|
| `Qualified` | `Tech Validation` | Total ≥ `PROGRESSION_GATE_TV_BV_TOTAL` AND E statement 1 = Yes AND I% ≥ `PROGRESSION_GATE_TV_BV_I_PCT` AND CH% ≥ `PROGRESSION_GATE_TV_BV_CH_PCT` |
| `Tech Validation` | `Business Validation` | Same as above (rows share the same gate per policy) |
| `Business Validation` | `Committed` | Total ≥ `PROGRESSION_GATE_COMMIT_TOTAL` AND E% ≥ `PROGRESSION_GATE_COMMIT_E_PCT` |
| `Prospect` | `Qualified` | Pass 3 not defined for this transition — set `progression_gate_passed = null`, `progression_gate_target = "Qualified"` (rendered as "未设进阶门槛" in view) |
| `Committed` / `Closed/Launched` | (terminal) | Pass 3 not applicable — set both fields to `null` |

**E statement 1 source:** Read from MEDDPICC Scorecard's Economic Buyer element row 1 ("已与 Economic Buyer 接触并提及了该项目" / "I have engaged with the Economic Buyer and discussed the initiative"). Value = Yes/No. Available from M.5's per-statement raw data.

**Pass 3 behavior — diagnostic only:**
- A failed Pass 3 does NOT set `rollback_recommended = true`. It does NOT trigger rollback by itself.
- A failed Pass 3 produces an advisory message in the alignment card: "推进到 [target_stage] 的进阶门槛未满足: [specific failed condition(s)]".
- If `current_stage = Tech Validation` (Pacvue's case) and Pass 2 also triggers rollback, the alignment card surfaces both: rollback advice from Pass 2, plus progression-gate diagnosis pointing forward.

**Output additions to M.12:**
- `progression_gate_passed` ∈ {`true`, `false`, `null`}
- `progression_gate_target` ∈ stage name or `null`
- `progression_gate_failed_conditions` = list of strings naming each unmet condition (e.g., `["Total 67 < 65 阈值 — 实际已达标，无此项"]` not included; only failures); empty list when `progression_gate_passed = true`

## M.13 Alignment Flags

**Output written to Session State:**
- `alignment_result` ∈ {`Aligned`, `Aligned — Strengthening Recommended`, `Rollback Recommended`, `Advancement Ready`}
- `rollback_recommended` = `true` if Pass 1 or Pass 2 triggered rollback; else `false`
- `rollback_target` = target stage when `rollback_recommended = true`; else `null`
- `rollback_reasons` = list of triggered conditions, written in sales-readable business language per **V.0.6** (e.g., `["Tech Validation 两条核心退出标准合计完成度只有 15%"]`, `["Qualified 阶段 EB 与 Champion 接触合计 98%，EB 实质未接触"]`)
- `progression_gate_passed` ∈ {`true`, `false`, `null`} — from Pass 3
- `progression_gate_target` ∈ stage name or `null` — from Pass 3
- `progression_gate_failed_conditions` = list of unmet conditions (empty when passed) — from Pass 3

Used by: Phase 3 stage-progression line, Phase 6 banner trigger, Phase 7 report banner, V.0.3 Standing Warning Banner.

## M.14 Element Relationship Status [shared: Phase 2, Phase 5]

**Inputs:** in-scope element scores, Element Relationship Matrix per `tier` (M.1.4).

**Output:**
- `primary_blocker` = `{element, score, rationale_text, source}`.
- `relationship_rows` = for each in-scope element: `{element, score_percent, priority, related_elements[], related_status_label, source}`.

**Rules — Priority assignment (fact-only, by score threshold):**
- `P0` — element % < 60% (At Risk).
- `P1` — 60% ≤ element % < 80% (Needs Improvement).
- `P2` — 80% ≤ element % < 100% (monitoring only — no Layer B card).
- `100%` — at score ceiling. Receives a `⚠️ 看似达标` flag in `related_status_label` if any related element scores < 80%; receives `—` and is **skipped from Layer A** if all related elements score ≥ 80%.

**Rules — `related_status_label` text per element:**
- For each in-scope element, list its related elements per M.1.4 with their scores.
- Append a fact-only summary of the lowest related-element score:
  - If any related element < 60% → `关联 [Element] ([%]) 处于 At Risk`
  - Else if any related element 60–80% → `关联 [Element] ([%]) 偏低`
  - Else (all related ≥ 80%) → `关联项均 ≥ 80%`
- For 100%-score elements with at least one related element < 80%, prefix with `⚠️ 看似达标 — `.
- No directional language ("拖累 / 受...拖累 / blocks / depends on / upstream / downstream") may appear anywhere in this output.

**Rules — Primary Blocker selection (fact-only):**
- Candidate set: all in-scope elements with priority `P0` first; if none, `P1`; if none, `P2`.
- Tiebreaker: lowest absolute score percentage.
- Secondary tiebreaker (when scores tied): element with the largest number of related elements scoring < 80%.

**Rules — `rationale_text` (HARD — specialization of V.0.6 for Primary Blocker):**

The `rationale_text` is what appears in the Phase 2 user-facing card next to the blocker element name. It MUST follow **V.0.6 User-Facing Language Rule** (no internal scoring jargon, no model node references, no academic caveats — see V.0.6 Section A for full forbidden list).

**Specialization beyond V.0.6: required structure (3 sentences, in this order):**

1. **What is missing concretely** — what business capability / artifact / commitment the customer has not yet given. Use specific nouns from the deal (e.g., "DSP 业务的 4 项基线指标", "EB 的口头价值确认", "法务/财务流程对齐"), not the element name.
2. **What it blocks** — what next step in the sales motion this gap prevents. Tie to the customer's deal mechanic, not to the scoring framework (e.g., "EB 无法对方案价值做出确认", "进入 Business Validation 缺少必要前置").
3. **Concrete consequence the sales rep can visualize** — describe the visible deal stall, NOT abstract sales-process labels. Use phrasing the rep would say in a Monday standup ("商机停在 Tech Validation 推不动", "EDP 谈判进不了下一轮", "下次 EBC 没东西可以汇报", "本季度 forecast 收不进来").

For full forbidden / allowed vocabulary, see V.0.6 Sections A–C. The full canonical example (positive form) is in V.0.6 Section F.

**Element field display rule:**

The `primary_blocker.element` field MUST contain only the element label — `[Code] — [Name]` (e.g., `M — Metrics`). Do NOT bake the score into this field. The view template renders `{element} · {score}` from the separate `score_pct` field. Avoid duplicating the percentage by including it in both `element` and `score`.

Cached after first computation; Phase 5 reuses.

## M.15 Exit Criteria Evaluation

**Inputs:** Scorecard exit criteria rows (Stage / Exit Criterion / Mapped Element), Scorecard Completion % column, element % from M.5, Remarks column, `tier`, in-scope elements per M.1.1.

**Output:** for each row: `{stage, exit_criterion, scorecard_completion_percent, mapped_element, element_percent, status, remarks_override_flag, source}`.

**Rules:**
- Use row-per-mapping granularity from M.1.3 (one element per row).
- Simple tier: skip rows mapped exclusively to out-of-scope elements (M, P, CH).
- Strategic tier: evaluate all rows.
- Row status driven by **mapped element %** (NOT Scorecard Completion %):
  - element % ≥ `STATUS_ON_TRACK` → `On Track` (✅)
  - `STATUS_NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT` ≤ element % < `STATUS_ON_TRACK` → `Needs Improvement` (⚠️)
  - element % < `STATUS_AT_RISK` → `At Risk` (🔴)
  - Remarks column has manual "At risk" flag → override status to `At Risk` regardless of element %, set `remarks_override_flag = true`.
- Scorecard Completion % column is retained for reporting (AE's self-assessment of progress) but does NOT drive status.

**Exit-criterion aggregate status (when one criterion has multiple rows):** lowest-status precedence.
- Any mapped element < 60% → exit-criterion is At Risk.
- Else any < 80% → Needs Improvement.
- Else On Track.

## M.16 Risk Bucketing

**Inputs:** M.15 row statuses, M.5 element scores, M.11 stage aggregates, current_stage, prior_stage, `tier`.

**Output:** three buckets, each a list of `{stage, element, finding, source}`:
- `foundation_risks` — prior stage exit criteria not met (lowest-status precedence At Risk).
- `progression_risks` — current stage exit criteria not met. When element score is high but Scorecard Completion % for the mapped exit criterion is far lower (or vice versa), include that contradiction inline as part of the finding text — do NOT spin a separate "contradictions" section.
- `meddpicc_risks`:
  - Strategic: EB < `MEDDPICC_RISK_EB_THRESHOLD` OR Champion < `MEDDPICC_RISK_CHAMPION_THRESHOLD`.
  - Simple: EB < `MEDDPICC_RISK_EB_THRESHOLD`.
  - When the same element also appears as root cause in Foundation or Progression bucket, reference once in MEDDPICC bucket and point back; do not re-list.

Element-level deep root-cause analysis is owned by M.17.

## M.17 Element Diagnostic

**Inputs:** in-scope element scores, M.14 priority + relationship labels, Scorecard Remarks, Potential Obstacles, Competitive Info, Phase 4 outputs (when Strategic).

**Output:**
- `layer_a_rows` — for each in-scope element where M.14 has assigned a priority of `P0` / `P1` / `P2` (i.e., scoring < 100%), AND for elements at 100% where M.14 has set `⚠️ 看似达标` (at least one related element < 80%): `{element_label, score_display, priority, related_status_label, source}`. Elements at 100% with all related elements ≥ 80% are skipped from Layer A.
- `layer_b_cards` — for each P0/P1 element: `{element, root_cause_text, diagnostic_evidence_text or null}`.

**Rules — Layer A priority:** assigned by M.14 from absolute score thresholds (P0 < 60%, P1 60–80%, P2 80–100%). M.17 consumes these directly — no re-derivation, no directional logic.

**Rules — Layer B Diagnostic Evidence inclusion (STRICT — include ONLY if at least one trigger):**
- **Cross-statement contradiction:** Yes statement logically conflicts with No statement in same or other element. Example: DC "EB confirmed AWS preference" = Yes while E "engaged with EB" = No.
- **Remarks-statement mismatch:** Remarks column says something contradicting statement scores. Example: Remarks says "found Champion" but CH statements scored 0.
- **Counter-intuitive No:** No on a statement that industry-standard practice would expect Yes at this stage.

**Do NOT include Diagnostic Evidence if:**
- It would just list which statements scored No (Scorecard restatement, no analytical value).
- All Nos point to same obvious fact (Root Cause paragraph already covers).
- User can read the same signal directly off the Scorecard without analytical assistance.

**Format:** when included, output as one italic line stating the specific contradiction/anomaly — NOT a bulleted list of Nos. Quote conflicting statements or reference Remarks cells. Use post-class ("课后") scored data only.

**Root Cause rules:**
- Causal ("why"), not descriptive ("what").
- 2–4 sentences.
- Draw from Scorecard Remarks, Potential Obstacles, Competitive Info, or tagged inference.
- If cause requires inference beyond Scorecard data, tag explicitly with ⚠️ inference tag per M.0.
- Cross-element contradictions surface here AND in Diagnostic Evidence (qualifies under cross-statement rule).
- Strategic tier: when Phase 4 competitive intel is relevant to root cause, weave in. If Phase 4 already flagged an element's score as fragile, reference rather than re-argue.
- Reference related elements by **fact, not direction** — e.g., "M and I are related elements per the matrix; both score below 80%, indicating shared treatment is needed". Never use "M is downstream of I", "I drives M", "M depends on I", or similar directional phrasing.
- Do NOT include "Impact if Unresolved" or "Recommendations" — those belong to Phase 6 (Action Plan).
- Specific source citations for "where" already in Layer A — do not duplicate in Root Cause.

## M.18 EB Identity Resolution

**Inputs:** Scorecard Competitive Info "EB Job Title" field (M.8 output), prior user input in current conversation.

**Output:** `eb_identity` (string or null), `no_persona_mode` (bool).

**EB identity sources (HARD — only these two):**
1. EB Job Title field in Scorecard Competitive Info sheet.
2. Explicit user input in current conversation (provided spontaneously, NOT prompted by the skill).

No other Scorecard fields infer EB. No training-data inference, no industry-convention guess.

**Resolution flow (silent — no user prompt):**
- Either source provides title → `eb_identity = title`, `no_persona_mode = false`.
- Neither source → `eb_identity = null`, `no_persona_mode = true`.

**No prompting:** M.18 NEVER renders a prompt and NEVER pauses for user input. If `eb_identity` cannot be resolved from the two hard sources, the skill silently enters degraded mode and continues. The user is not interrupted to "fill in" missing information.

**Optional EB hint at end of Phase 5:** when `no_persona_mode = true`, the verification-questions view appends a single optional hint line at the very end of Phase 5 output (see `view:phase5.verification-questions`). The hint is purely informational — it does NOT block, does NOT pause, and does NOT require a response.

**Downstream impact:** when `no_persona_mode = true`:
- Step 4 (`contact-profiling` + `cxo-personas` skill calls) is skipped.
- `view:phase5.stakeholder-profiling` falls back to LLM-internal-knowledge role archetypes (no EB-specific overlay).
- `view:phase5.persona-traits-applied` is omitted entirely.
- `view:phase5.verification-questions` uses generic phrasing without EB-role calibration.

## M.19 Question Generation

**Inputs:** P0/P1 elements from M.17 Layer A, `eb_identity`, `no_persona_mode`, Phase 4 industry terminology (when available), Opportunity Location.

**Output:** for each P0/P1 element: `{element, persona_traits_applied[], main_questions[], follow_up_questions[]}`.

**Rules:**

**Hard caps (per M.2):**
- Total budget across all P0/P1 elements ≤ `QUESTION_BUDGET_TOTAL` (12 main questions).
- Per element by priority (NOT by raw score — use M.14 priority):
  - **P0** (score < 60%, At Risk) → `QUESTION_BUDGET_P0`: **2–3 main** + up to 2 follow-ups each. The 2–3 main questions must target genuinely different angles (e.g., 不同 stakeholder 视角、不同维度的验证). If three angles cannot be justified, ship 2.
  - **P1** (60% ≤ score < 80%, Needs Improvement) → `QUESTION_BUDGET_P1`: **2 main** + up to 1 follow-up each.
  - **P2** (≥ 80%, monitoring only) → `QUESTION_BUDGET_P2`: **skipped**. Do NOT generate questions for P2 elements.
- If sum across all P0/P1 elements would exceed 12 main, drop the lowest-priority elements first. Within the same priority band, drop the element with the highest score (least urgent). Never split a 2-question allocation — drop or keep whole.

**Skip P2 elements** — monitoring-only; their score health does not require active verification at this cycle.

**De-duplication (MANDATORY):** before output, scan for overlap. Two questions targeting same information goal through different phrasing → collapse into one main + follow-ups. A question earns its slot only if it unlocks information others cannot.

**Persona-to-Question Mapping (when `no_persona_mode = false`):**
- For each element, populate `persona_traits_applied[]` with 2–3 specific traits from Stakeholder Profiling that shaped question design.
- Each main question's phrasing, vocabulary, and tone must reflect those traits.

**Degraded mode (when `no_persona_mode = true`):**
- `persona_traits_applied[]` empty.
- Generate questions from element gaps alone — no persona-shaped phrasing, no vocabulary references to specific EB role, no industry-specific tone calibration based on EB seniority.

**Each main question carries:**
- `purpose` (why ask)
- `expected_insights` (what surface)
- `follow_up_suggestions` (carry second-angle gathering without inflating main count)

**Tone:** conversational, non-threatening, naturally extracts MEDDPICC information. Strengthens AWS value positioning; do NOT expose competitive intelligence. Adapts to Opportunity Location culture.

## M.20 Phase 2-6 Consistency Rules

**Inputs:** Phase 2 outputs (`primary_blocker`, `30_day_targets`, score display), Phase 5 outputs, current Phase 3 unmet exit criteria.

**Output:** `winning_strategies` (list, ≤3, high-level), `weekly_actions` (list, grouped by week, action-first), `success_metrics` (list, ≤3, with strategy tags), all with binding constraints enforced.

**Rules (HARD — violation invalidates Phase 6):**

1. **Score display matches Phase 2 Section 2 exactly:**
   - Strategic: `[Score]/100`.
   - Simple: `EDDIC [Score]/63 = [Z]%`.
2. **Analytical stage matches Phase 2's reported stage.** Phase 2 advisories (rollback / advancement) do NOT reframe.
3. **Strategy 1 MUST target the Primary Blocker** named in Phase 2 Section 3. Order is locked.
4. **Key Success Metrics = expanded Phase 2 30-day targets:** same elements, same thresholds, same count (≤ 3). Add verification condition + Strategy tag. Do NOT introduce new elements or change thresholds.
5. **Metric count ≤ 3, aligned with Phase 2.** If Phase 2 listed 2 targets, Phase 6 produces 2 Strategies and 2 Metrics.

**Strategy generation (high-level overview only — no W-action details inside Strategy):**
- Number of Strategies = number of Key Success Metrics = number of Phase 2 30-day targets.
- Each Strategy maps 1:1 to one Phase 2 headline target (same underlying element).
- Each Strategy entry contains:
  - `id`: short tag like `S1`, `S2`, `S3` (used in weekly action `strategy_tags` field)
  - `title`: directional and action-oriented (e.g., "建立 EB 接触通道"), NOT descriptive (e.g., "Improve E score")
  - `target`: the Phase 2 30-day threshold (e.g., "M ≥ 60%")
  - `rationale`: one sentence citing BOTH (a) Deal Assessment reference (Primary Blocker / 30-day target) AND (b) specific unmet Phase 3 exit criterion.
- **Strategy block does NOT contain weekly actions.** Weekly actions live in the separate `weekly_actions` structure (action-first).

**Weekly action generation (action-first, calendar-event de-dup):**

Output structure: `weekly_actions = [{week: "W1", actions: [{description, owner, verification, strategy_tags: [S1, S3]}]}, ...]`.

- Each action ≤ `ACTION_DESCRIPTION_MAX_CHARS`.
- Each action carries `strategy_tags` — list of Strategy ids the action contributes to (one or many).
- Actions are listed in chronological order grouped by week. Weeks with no action are skipped.
- W1 actions verifiable within the week — no vague "gather information" or "align stakeholders".
- W1 includes an action whose description is an expanded version of Phase 2's "Immediate Action (This Week)" — same core action with added specificity.
- Later-week actions may carry dependencies — state explicitly in description ("depends on W1 outcome"), not implicit.

**Calendar-event de-duplication (SOFT rule):**

When generating weekly actions, before emitting two action entries that look like the same calendar event, check the following heuristic:

```
def is_same_calendar_event(action_a, action_b):
    return (
        action_a.week == action_b.week AND
        action_a.owner == action_b.owner AND
        actions describe the same physical event / deliverable
        (e.g., same meeting subject, same document, same call participants)
    )
```

If `is_same_calendar_event` evaluates true, **merge into a single action entry** with `strategy_tags` containing all involved Strategy ids. Examples:

- ✅ Merge: `W3 [S1] David 牵头三方会议升级 v2` + `W3 [S2] David 牵头三方会议验证推动力` + `W3 [S3] David 牵头三方会议确认 I 量化` → `W3 [S1·S2·S3] David 牵头三方会议，发布"业务成功指标 v2"` (same physical meeting, three strategies served simultaneously)
- ❌ Do NOT merge: `W3 [S1] 与 David 复盘基线表 v2` + `W3 [S2] 与 David 复盘三方会议反馈` (same week + same owner, but different agendas / deliverables — these are two separate 1-on-1s or one meeting with explicitly partitioned segments). When unsure, keep separate.

The rule is SOFT because LLM judgment is required to decide whether two descriptions are truly the same calendar event. The View renders whatever Model emits — Model is the authority on de-duplication, not the View.

**Metrics rules:**
- Threshold from Phase 2, not reinvented.
- Verification condition must be objective ("EB meeting held with v2 doc" / "量化指标 EB 口头确认"), not subjective ("alignment improved").
- Each metric carries `strategy_tag` (single Strategy id, since metric maps 1:1 to a Strategy).
- Optionally also carry `source_week` (e.g., "W4–W5") to trace which weeks' actions yield this metric's verification — helpful for retrospective review.

## M.21 Weekly Horizon Logic

**Inputs:** `rollback_recommended`, current-stage aggregate from M.11.

**Output:** `weekly_horizon` (integer 4–8), `horizon_extension_reason` (string or null).

**Rules:**
- Default: `WEEKLY_HORIZON_DEFAULT` (4 weeks).
- Extended to 6–8 weeks when `WEEKLY_HORIZON_EXTEND_TRIGGER` matches: `rollback_recommended = true` AND current-stage aggregate < 30%. State extension reason explicitly (V renders as italic note: "_Horizon extended to 6 weeks because Qualified foundation is at 22%._").

## M.22 Report Data Dict Assembly

**Inputs:** Session State, all phase outputs in context, `phases_completed`.

**Output:** structured data dict matching `examples/sample-data.json` contract.

**Top-level keys and source mappings:**

| Key | Source | When populated |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | Phase 1B basic info | Always |
| `rollback_banner` | `rollback_recommended` + `rollback_reasons` | Only when `rollback_recommended = true`; otherwise omit key entirely |
| `phase2` | Phase 2 outputs (consolidated: deal health + stage alignment + progression gate) | If Phase 2 in `phases_completed` |
| `phase25` | DEPRECATED — kept for backward compatibility with legacy report templates. New reports populate everything under `phase2`. | Omit unless legacy template requires |
| `phase3` | M.15 rows + M.11 aggregation + M.16 risk buckets | If Phase 3 in `phases_completed` |
| `phase4` | Phase 4 three sections + Compete block. Set `show: false` if skipped | If Phase 4 in `phases_completed` |
| `phase5` | M.17 Layer A + Layer B + Stakeholder Profiling + M.19 questions | If Phase 5 in `phases_completed` |
| `phase6` | M.20 strategies + M.21 horizon + Metrics | If Phase 6 in `phases_completed` |

**Color tokens** (M3 semantic names — template maps to `--md-sys-color-*` variables; never hard-coded hex):
- Status / priority: `success`, `warning`, `error`, `primary`.
- Stakeholder tag pairs (`tag_bg` / `tag_fg`):
  - Champion / Supporter → `success-container` / `on-success-container`
  - Neutral → `warning-container` / `on-warning-container`
  - Skeptic / At Risk → `error-container` / `on-error-container`
  - Economic Buyer → `secondary-container` / `on-primary-container`
  - Coach → `surface-container-highest` / `on-surface-variant`

If a new category is needed, extend `:root` in template and reference by variable name — do not introduce hex inline.

## M.23 File Naming & Collision

**Inputs:** Opportunity Name (preferred) or Customer Name (fallback), save path, current date.

**Output:** absolute file path for the report.

**Rules:**
- Naming: `progression-report-[opportunity-name-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].html`.
- `opportunity-name-slug` from Opportunity Name field. Transform: lowercase, spaces → hyphens, Chinese characters preserved, strip path-unsafe characters (`/ \ : * ? " < > |`), truncate to 60 chars.
- Missing Opportunity Name → fall back to `progression-report-[customer-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].html` and note fallback in V delivery confirmation.
- Collision: append `-v2`, `-v3`, etc. if file exists.
- Save path: empty/Enter → current working directory; otherwise expand `~` and use provided path. Create directory if not exists.

## M.24 Model Snapshot Persistence (machine-readable)

**Purpose:** Persist a complete Model-layer snapshot of the skill session for downstream machine consumption — re-runs / diff comparison / external system handoff. NOT user-facing; never rendered by any view.

**Inputs:** complete Session State + all `M.x` outputs accumulated during the session, `phases_completed`.

**Output:** JSON file written to a fixed root directory, independent of the user-facing report path.

**Storage location (fixed, not user-configurable):**

```
~/.dali/opportunity-progression/snapshots/
```

The directory is created if it doesn't exist. This is a stable agent-level location separate from `~/Sales/{Customer}/` (where Phase 7 reports go). It is shared across all customers and opportunities.

**File naming (HARD):**

```
{customer-slug}__{opportunity-slug}__{YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm}.json
```

- `customer-slug` and `opportunity-slug` use the same slug transform as M.23 (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, Chinese preserved, path-unsafe characters stripped, truncated to 60 chars).
- `{YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm}` is the timestamp at write time, in local time.
- The double-underscore (`__`) separator distinguishes parts since slugs may contain hyphens.
- Example: `pacvue__beijing-dsp-ad-investment__2026-05-19-1430.json`
- Collision: if the same path exists (sub-minute re-run), append `-v2`, `-v3`, etc.

    "M.21_weekly_horizon": { ... }
  }
}
```

**Field rules:**

- Every node entry MUST be the actual structured output of that node. If a node was not invoked in this session (e.g., Phase 4 skipped at Simple tier with no competitors), set the value to `null`.
- Source attribution (per M.0) MUST be preserved in every nested entry — `source` field carried verbatim.
- Internal scoring vocabulary (At Risk / P0 / 阈值 / etc.) IS allowed in this file — V.0.6 forbidden vocab does NOT apply, since this is machine-only data.
- `scorecard_file_hash` enables detecting whether the underlying Scorecard changed between runs (for diff). Computed if the original file path is available; `null` otherwise.

**Write behavior:**

- Phase 7 writes the snapshot once, at the same step as the report HTML write (Phase 7 Step 5 → expanded to also persist Model snapshot).
- File is written atomically (write to `*.tmp`, rename) to avoid partial writes on interrupt.
- No retry on failure — if write fails (disk full, permission), surface the error in the delivery confirmation but do NOT block report generation.
- The snapshot file is silent in user output. The delivery confirmation (Phase 7 view) MAY mention "Model snapshot stored" with the path as a one-liner footnote, but should NOT be the primary content.

**Read behavior (for future re-runs / diff):**

- M.24 produces the file. Reading it back is the responsibility of any future skill invocation that wants to consume historical snapshots.
- Naming convention guarantees: alphabetical sort within `{customer}/{opportunity}` groups gives chronological order.
- Future M.x extension (e.g., "M.25 Snapshot Diff") may use this file as input.

**Privacy / safety:**

- The snapshot may contain customer-identifying data (names, contacts, deal sizes). It is treated with same sensitivity as the rendered report.
- The directory `~/.dali/` is on the user's local machine; not synced anywhere by this skill.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROCEDURE 3 — VIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Templates contain placeholders only — no `if/then` logic, no recomputation, no judgment. Decisions belong in Model and are passed in as values.

Naming: `view:phase<N>.<purpose>` for phase-specific templates, `view:shared.<purpose>` for cross-phase.

## V.0 Language Standard (register / phrasing / bilingual / numeric attribution base)

**Authority:** V.0 governs **how words are styled**. **V.0.6 governs which words are forbidden / allowed** for user-facing strings. Where they overlap on vocabulary, V.0.6 wins. V.0's bilingual rendering rules (below) and numeric attribution rules remain authoritative.

Register: senior sales manager writing a business analysis. Tone: professional, neutral, analytical. Persona governs *what* is analyzed; this rule governs *how* it is worded.

**Phrasing:** Declarative and precise, attributed to analysis rather than anthropomorphized.

| ✅ Use | ❌ Avoid |
|---|---|
| "Analysis indicates rollback to Prospect is warranted." | "Data says you should roll back." |
| "The opportunity shows no EB engagement (E = 0%)." | "You haven't touched the EB yet." |
| "M (0%) is At Risk; relates to I (67%), itself below 80%." (Model layer) | "E is the bottleneck — go get the EB." |

**Note on `At Risk` etc. above:** these are Model-layer phrasings — fine in source data and Model output. View layer (per V.0.6) substitutes with concrete deal language.

**Chinese / English:**
- MEDDPICC element codes stay in English (M, E, DC, DP, P, I, CH, CP) regardless of `language`.
- Section headers, status tags, narrative follow `language`.
- Chinese register is formal business: 商机进展 / 关键障碍 / 阶段对齐性评估, not colloquial 卡点 / 对齐一下 / 搞定.

**Bilingual label rendering (HARD):** Templates show many labels in `中文 / English` form (e.g., `30 天改进目标 / 30-Day Improvement Targets`). Both sides are kept in template text for cross-language documentation. **At render time, output only the side matching `language`:**

| `language` | Output |
|---|---|
| `zh-CN` | Simplified Chinese side only |
| `zh-TW` | Traditional Chinese side only — apply Traditional substitutions where template shows Simplified |
| `en` | English side only |

The separator ` / ` is the explicit signal of a bilingual label. Single-language phrases without ` / ` are NOT auto-translated — they are source-data quotes (e.g., Excel column `课后`) or fixed proper nouns. For narrative phrases needing translation but lacking a ` / ` form, see V.0.5.

**Numbers with attribution:** State figures with source per V.0.1. Example: `E = 10/15 = 67% (source: Scorecard Element score)`. NOT `E is fairly low` or `E 偏低`.

**Drop:**
- Dramatic contrast framing.
- Imperatives directed at the user ("回一个", "pick one").
- Attitudinal adverbs ("exactly", "honestly", "obviously").
- Persona flavor phrases ("the seasoned closer sees...").
- Slang / gaming metaphors / sports idioms ("追分", "seasoned closer", "the deal is stuck", "punchy").
- Directional metaphors for element relationships ("upstream / downstream / cascading / drives / depends on") — the matrix is symmetric.

**Verbatim output blocks:** any "output verbatim" instruction elsewhere is subordinate to V.0 + V.0.6. If conflict, V.0.6 wins (vocabulary), then V.0 (register / phrasing).

## V.0.1 Data Attribution Display (cross-layer with M.0)

Render source alongside any value.

**Inline citation format (preferred):**
- `E = 10/15 = 67% (source: Scorecard / MEDDPICC / E final statement weight 5)`
- `EB Job Title: CFO (source: Scorecard Competitive Info sheet)`

**Footnote format:** numbered references at end of section. Use only when inline would clutter; inline is preferred.

**Inference tag:** when source is `⚠️ Industry/role-based inference, not from Scorecard or connected interfaces`, render the tag verbatim alongside the value.

Never describe an element as low/high/strong/weak without actual percentage and source.

## V.0.2 Reserved Interface Transparency (cross-layer)

When a phase references a reserved interface, status MUST appear in output.

Connected:
```
[Interface #N — Name]: connected. [optional one-line summary]
```

Not connected:
```
[Interface #N — Name]: ⚠️ Not connected. Using LLM internal knowledge as fallback.
```

Never silently omit an interface reference.

## V.0.3 Standing Warning Banner (cross-layer with M.13)

When `rollback_recommended = true`, every Phase 3–6 output (and the Phase 7 report header) prepends a sales-readable rollback banner. The banner is two lines:

```
🔴 建议回退到 [rollback_target]
[rollback_banner.reason — one or two sentences in sales-readable language]
```

**`rollback_banner.reason` rules (HARD — specialization of V.0.6 for the rollback banner):**

The `reason` text is what appears under the banner title. It MUST follow **V.0.6 User-Facing Language Rule** (see V.0.6 Sections A–C for full forbidden / allowed vocabulary).

**Specialization beyond V.0.6: required content (3 items, woven into 1–2 sentences):**

1. **What concretely failed** — the specific exit criterion(s) or stakeholder gap that triggered rollback. Use deal-specific nouns (e.g., "Tech Validation 两条核心退出标准", "EB Ava 实质未接触"), NOT scoring labels.
2. **What stage the deal actually is at** — the rollback target framed as the deal's true position (e.g., "商机其实还停在 Qualified", "其实还停在 Prospect 阶段").
3. **Why the rest of the report still uses the reported stage** — explained as a caveat the rep can quickly understand (e.g., "下面的分析按 Tech Validation 在做，分数容易显得过分乐观").

**Examples:**

- ❌ "Tech Validation 阶段聚合完成度 15%（< 60% 阈值）；当前阶段两条核心退出标准均未实质推进。"
- ❌ "Stakeholder Gate 触发：EB% (15%) + Champion% (83%) = 98%，低于 Qualified 阶段 100% 阈值。"
- ✅ "Tech Validation 两条核心退出标准（架构共识、技术方案达成一致）合计完成度只有 15%，商机其实还停在 Qualified；下面的分析按 Tech Validation 在做，分数容易显得过分乐观。"
- ✅ "Qualified 阶段 EB 与 Champion 接触完整度合计仅 98%（< 100%），且 EB Ava 实质未接触；商机其实还停在 Prospect；下面的分析按 Qualified 在做，分数容易显得过分乐观。"

`view:shared.warning-banner` — slots filled from `current_stage`, `rollback_target`, `rollback_reasons`, gap elements from M.16.

## V.0.4 Symbol Vocabulary

See M.1.6. No symbol may be redefined within a template.

## V.0.5 Phrase Translation Table

Bilingual labels with ` / ` are handled by V.0. This table covers single-language fixed phrases that need language-driven translation. At render time, substitute by `language`.

| Source phrase (template) | `zh-CN` | `zh-TW` | `en` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Proceeding to Deal Assessment.` | 进入 Deal Assessment 阶段。 | 進入 Deal Assessment 階段。 | Proceeding to Deal Assessment. |
| `Open the file in a browser to view.` | 用浏览器打开文件查看。 | 用瀏覽器開啟檔案查看。 | Open the file in a browser to view. |
| `For PDF or Word copies, reply "导出 PDF" or "导出 Word".` | 需要 PDF 或 Word 版本，回复 "导出 PDF" 或 "导出 Word"。 | 需要 PDF 或 Word 版本，回覆 "導出 PDF" 或 "導出 Word"。 | For PDF or Word copies, reply `导出 PDF` or `导出 Word`. |
| `Sections rendered:` | 已渲染的分块： | 已渲染的分塊： | Sections rendered: |
| `connected.` (interface status) | 已连接。 | 已連接。 | connected. |
| `Not connected. Using LLM internal knowledge as fallback.` | 未连接。回退使用 LLM 内部知识。 | 未連接。回退使用 LLM 內部知識。 | Not connected. Using LLM internal knowledge as fallback. |

NOT translated:
- Confirmation tokens (`continue` / `proceed` / `下一步` / `go`) — user input recognizers.
- Excel column quotes (`课后`, `Completion %`) — source-data field names.

If a new fixed phrase is added to a template and needs translation, extend this table rather than embedding language switches in the template.

## V.0.6 User-Facing Language Rule (HARD — single source of truth for all View output)

This is the **single source of truth** for every string a sales rep will read in any output (chat, HTML report, PDF, Word). It applies to:

- All `view:*` templates
- Every free-text field rendered from data (`rationale`, `root_cause`, `evidence`, `relationship_note`, risk text, action description, strategy rationale, banner reason, etc.)
- Every Phase 2–7 user-facing string

**Sister rules — narrower specializations of V.0.6 (still must be honored):**
- **V.0** Language Standard — register, phrasing, bilingual rendering, numeric attribution conventions. V.0.6 absorbs V.0's vocabulary table; for register / formality, V.0 still governs.
- **M.14 `rationale_text` rules** — Primary Blocker rationale, 3-sentence structure.
- **V.0.3 `rollback_banner.reason` rules** — banner reason, 3-content-item structure.
- **Phase 2 view template placeholders** — section-specific phrasing notes.

If any of these specializations conflict with V.0.6's substitution table or forbidden list, **V.0.6 wins**. Specializations may add stricter rules but cannot relax V.0.6.

**Audience assumption:** A working sales rep at AWS opening this report on Monday morning. They have ~30 seconds before deciding whether to keep reading. They are MEDDPICC-aware but do NOT know this skill's internal scoring/algorithm vocabulary. They want to know: *what's wrong, why does it matter to my deal, what do I do this week*.

---

### Section A — Forbidden vocabulary in user-facing output

**A1. Scoring labels (never bare; always replace with deal-specific description):**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `P0` / `P1` / `P2` (as bare labels) | scoring band — internal classification |
| `At Risk` / `Needs Improvement` / `On Track` (as bare labels) | scoring labels — say what's actually wrong |
| `阈值` / `threshold` | scoring rule artifact — describe what the customer hasn't done |
| `tiebreak` / `tiebreaker` | algorithm — internal |
| `fact-only` | methodology label — internal |

Note: `P0` / `P1` / `P2` MAY appear as priority badges in Phase 5 Layer A table (where they are the column meaning), but the **rationale and free-text descriptions** must not rely on these labels alone.

**A2. Aggregation / threshold language:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `聚合完成度` (raw form) | analytic noun — say "两条退出标准合计完成 X%" instead |
| `进阶门槛` | gate label — say "还差 X / Y / Z 才能进 [next stage]" |
| `60% / 80% / 100% 阈值` (without context) | bare threshold — explain what the threshold means in deal terms |

**A3. Data-structure jargon:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `矩阵` / `interdependency matrix` | data structure — never explain the matrix to sales |
| `Layer A` / `Layer B` (in narrative — section headers OK in Phase 5 since they're consistent template anchors) | structure label |
| `看似达标` (Phase 5 Layer A flag — keep flag itself, but never write it inside a paragraph) | flag label leaking into narrative |
| `MEDDPICC 框架归类` / `按 MEDDPICC 体系算 Coach` | meta-framework reference; just state the role and what evidence supports it |

**A4. Phase / model node references:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `Phase 2 Primary Blocker = ...` | cross-phase reference — sales doesn't track phases |
| `M.14`, `M.20`, any model node id | implementation detail |
| `Phase 3-6 结果按当前阶段解读` | technical caveat |

**A5. Internal flag names:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `Stakeholder Gate` / `Exit Criteria Gate` / `Stage Progression Gate` | gate names — internal |
| `Pass 1` / `Pass 2` / `Pass 3` | pass numbers — internal |
| `Foundation Risk` / `Progression Risk` / `MEDDPICC Risk` (as section badges) | bucket labels — internal classification |

**A6. Academic / defensive caveats:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| `需视为可能过于乐观` | academic hedge — say "下面的分析按当前阶段在做，分数容易显得过分乐观" |
| `关键前置条件` / `必要 milestone` / `重要节点` / `关键环节` | filler modifiers — name the actual deal mechanic |
| `诊断性建议` / `不会自动改变 CRM 数据` | system-level disclaimer — sales rep already knows reports are advisory |
| `Champion 元素 X% 未达 60% 验证门槛` | scoring-rule speak — describe what David / Champion can't do |

**A7. Slang / informal imagery (V.0 inheritance — re-stated):**

Avoid: 追分 / Score Push, seasoned closer, Gatekeeper, the deal is stuck, punchy, gaming metaphors, sports idioms, directional metaphors for element relationships ("upstream / downstream / cascading / drives / depends on" — the matrix is symmetric).

---

### Section B — Substitution patterns (Model output → View render)

| If model produces | View must render as |
|---|---|
| `M is P0 (At Risk)` | `M 0%（4 项基线指标都没建立）` — score + concrete description |
| `Tech Validation 出口标准未达成` | `Tech Validation 两条退出标准（[name them]）合计完成 X%` |
| `M 与 I 在矩阵中相关` | `M 和 I 都低分，要一起治理` (or omit if not needed) |
| `Tech Validation 阶段聚合完成度 15% (< 60% 阈值)` | `Tech Validation 两条退出标准合计只完成 15%` |
| `进阶门槛未满足` | `还差 X / Y / Z 才能进 [next stage]`（具体列项） |
| `Phase 3-6 结果按当前阶段解读，但需视为可能过于乐观` | `下面的分析按当前阶段在做，分数容易显得过分乐观` |
| `Foundation Risk / Progression Risk / MEDDPICC Risk` | `上一阶段未做到位 / 当前阶段卡点 / 关键人物缺位` |
| `按 MEDDPICC 框架归类为 Coach：Champion 元素 33% 未达验证门槛` | `客户口头识别为内部联系人，但 [Name] 的权力和影响力还没验证（CH 评分只 33%）— 现在只能算 Coach（能给信息但推不动签字）` |
| `E = 0% At Risk; foundation gap` | `EB 还没接触；商机其实还停在 Prospect / Qualified` |

---

### Section C — Allowed canonical phrasing

| Concept | Allowed phrasing |
|---|---|
| Element score state | `M 0%（基线指标空白）`、`I 67%（痛点已识别但损失未量化）` — score + concrete description, never label only |
| Stage relationship | `商机其实还停在 [stage] 推不动`、`下一步进入 [stage] 卡在 [thing]` |
| Element relationship | `M 和 I 都低，需要一起补齐` (when relevant; omit if no concrete action implied) |
| Required action language | `缺少 / 尚未 / 阻碍 / 推进受阻 / 推不动` |
| Visualizable stalls | `商机停在 [stage] 推不动`、`EDP 谈判进不了下一轮`、`下次 EBC 没东西可以汇报`、`本季度 forecast 收不进来` |
| Role normalization | `Coach (能给信息但推不动签字)`、`Champion candidate (待验证)`、`Champion (已验证)`、`EB (Economic Buyer)` |
| Risk bucket labels (when displayed) | `上一阶段未做到位` / `当前阶段卡点` / `关键人物缺位` |

---

### Section D — Per-surface specialization summaries

These are the surfaces with stricter content rules. The forbidden vocabulary above applies universally; below adds per-surface structure.

| Surface | Rules |
|---|---|
| **Phase 2 `primary_blocker.rationale`** | M.14 — 3 sentences: (1) what's missing concretely, (2) what it blocks, (3) visualizable stall |
| **Phase 2 `rollback_banner.reason`** | V.0.3 — 3 content items: (1) what concretely failed, (2) what stage the deal actually is at, (3) why the rest of report still uses reported stage |
| **Phase 2 verdict `rationale[]`** | 2–3 short paragraphs, plain Chinese, name specific exit criteria + gap elements; no defensive disclaimer language |
| **Phase 2 `progression_gaps.items`** | One bullet per missing condition, format `[element] = [score]% → 目标 [target]%` or `[concrete action] (when statement-level gap)`. No "阈值" wording. |
| **Phase 3 `risks[].kind`** | Use sales-readable bucket label (`上一阶段未做到位` / `当前阶段卡点` / `关键人物缺位`), not internal classification (`Foundation Risk` etc.) |
| **Phase 3 `risks[].text`** | Name the specific stage + exit criterion + element. Describe what the customer has / hasn't done. No bare thresholds. |
| **Phase 5 `relationship_note`** | One short clause describing what's true about this element's situation. No `关联 X · Y` raw matrix dump. |
| **Phase 5 Layer B `evidence`** | Quote conflicting Scorecard statements, name the contradiction in plain language. |
| **Phase 5 Layer B `root_cause`** | 2–4 sentences. Cite Scorecard remarks/notes, customer business context. No "矩阵中相关联" / "处于 At Risk" / "未达 80% 阈值". |
| **Phase 5 stakeholder `desc`** | Quote the Scorecard text where the contact appears, then describe role + what's verified vs. unverified. Use Coach / Champion candidate / Champion / EB labels only. |
| **Phase 6 strategy `rationale`** | One sentence linking the strategy to a real deal mechanic (Primary Blocker / 30-day target / unmet exit criterion). No `Phase 2 Primary Blocker = ...` cross-references. |
| **Phase 6 weekly action `description`** | Concrete action with contact / meeting type / deliverable. Avoid generic phrasing ("gather information", "align stakeholders"). |
| **Phase 7 banner / footer** | No `AWS Sales Agent` / `Scorecard: ...` system-meta footer. Use `Generated by Opportunity Progression Skill · Dali Agent` and `Report Date: ...` only. |

---

### Section E — Renderer checklist (every view template MUST satisfy before emit)

1. ✅ No element label appears without a concrete description of what's missing
2. ✅ No threshold number appears without an explanation of what it means for the deal
3. ✅ No data-structure noun (矩阵 / Layer / Gate / Pass) appears in user-facing strings
4. ✅ No phase or model node id appears in user-facing strings
5. ✅ Risk bucket labels (if used) translated to plain Chinese sales language
6. ✅ Role labels (Coach / Champion candidate / Champion / EB) — never raw "Supporter / Sponsor / Stakeholder"
7. ✅ No defensive system-level disclaimer ("诊断性建议", "不会改变 CRM")
8. ✅ Every percentage cited in narrative has a concrete description (not just `M 0%`)

---

### Section F — Examples (full sentences)

**Banner reason:**

- ❌ `Tech Validation 阶段聚合完成度 15%（< 60% 阈值）；当前阶段两条核心退出标准均未实质推进。`
- ✅ `Tech Validation 两条核心退出标准（架构共识、技术方案达成一致）合计完成度只有 15%，商机其实还停在 Qualified；下面的分析按 Tech Validation 在做，分数容易显得过分乐观。`

**Primary Blocker rationale:**

- ❌ `M 处于 P0 优先级（0% < 60% At Risk 阈值）；与 M 在矩阵中相关的 2 个评估项中，I (67%) 也处于 60–80% 偏低区间。按 P0 优先 + 最低分 tiebreak，M 是当前 Primary Blocker。`
- ❌ `DSP 业务的 4 项基线指标尚未量化。没有量化基线，EB 无法对方案价值做出确认。这阻碍了进入 Business Validation 的关键前置条件。` (third sentence too vague)
- ✅ `DSP 业务的 4 项基线指标（投放预算 / ROAS / CPM / 续费率）尚未量化。没有这些数字，EB 没法对方案价值做出确认。这一步过不去，商机就停在 Tech Validation 推不动。`

**Phase 5 root_cause:**

- ❌ `M 与 I 在矩阵中相关联，I 同样未达 80%，两者需共同治理。`
- ✅ `M 和 I 都低分，要一起补：先把痛点损失量化出来，指标就有锚点了。`

**Phase 6 strategy rationale:**

- ❌ `Phase 2 Primary Blocker = M · 0%；Tech Validation 出口标准'技术成功指标已建立'未满足。`
- ✅ `M 是当前关键阻塞（4 项基线指标全空白）；本季度 review 的'技术成功指标已建立'这条要求也卡在这里。`

**Stakeholder David description:**

- ❌ `按 MEDDPICC 框架归类为 Coach：Champion 元素 33% 未达 60% 验证门槛，CH 第 1、2 条 = No，权力与影响力维度未验证。`
- ✅ `Sheet1 备注：'确认了 supporter 是 David'。客户口头识别为内部联系人，但 David 的权力和影响力还没验证（CH 评分只 33%）— 现在只能算 Coach（能给信息但推不动签字）。Phase 6 通过具体动作验证后，再决定能不能升级为 Champion 候选。`

---

### Section G — Cross-reference

- M.14 `rationale_text` rules — specialization for Primary Blocker rationale (still authoritative for its 3-sentence structure).
- V.0.3 Standing Warning Banner — specialization for rollback banner.
- V.0 Language Standard — base register / phrasing / bilingual rendering rules.

V.0.6 supersedes V.0's vocabulary table where they overlap. V.0's bilingual rendering rules and numeric attribution rules remain authoritative.

## V.0.7 Inferred Scorecard Banner (cross-layer with M.3-Auto)

When `scorecard_source = "auto-inferred-accepted"`, every Phase 2–7 output (and the Phase 7 report header) prepends an Inferred Scorecard banner. This is independent of the Rollback banner (V.0.3) — both can render simultaneously, with the Inferred banner above the Rollback banner.

```
ℹ️ 本次分析基于 AI 自动推断的 Scorecard。整体推断信心：[overall_confidence: 高 | 中 | 低]。
[N] / [Total] 条陈述有明确证据；其余由"无足够信息推断"默认为 No。
建议关键 review 前用上传或填表单的方式校准。
```

**Slot fills:**
- `overall_confidence` — from `inference_confidence.overall`.
- `[N]`, `[Total]` — counted from M.3-Auto inferred_statements where `confidence != low` (or where `source != "无足够信息推断"`).

**Render rules:**
- Always render in `surface-container` (neutral / blue) styling, NOT warning yellow — distinguishes "AI 推断" from "Rollback 警告" so banners don't visually compete.
- The banner is permanent across all subsequent phases until skill session ends.
- Phase 7 HTML report includes the same banner verbatim at the top of the report (above the Rollback banner if also present).

**Rationale:** the user already opted into this path in Phase 1A and saw the per-statement review in Phase 1A-Auto. The banner is a persistent reminder, not a re-confirmation prompt.

# 商机分级 / Opportunity Classification

请参考下方 4 维度矩阵确认商机分级。

## 4-Dimension Matrix

| Dimension | Commodity | Simple | Strategic |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Solution complexity | Standard product, direct use | Light config / option comparison | Custom design / architecture / POC |
| Reversibility | Fully reversible (use and walk) | Low lock-in (discount refundable) | High lock-in (switching very expensive) |
| Decision cycle | <2 weeks | 2–8 weeks | >8 weeks |
| Deal size (ARR) *— Reference only* | <$50K | $50K–$200K | >$200K |

First three dimensions drive the classification. Deal size is reference context only — it cross-checks but does not decide.

## 请确认分级 / Your Classification

- "Commodity" — 退出工具，输出升级信号监测清单
- "Simple" — 请上传 EDDIC Scorecard（5 个要素）
- "Strategic" — 请上传 MEDDPICC Scorecard（8 个要素）

# Commodity Confirmed — Upgrade Signals to Watch

This opportunity does not need MEDDPICC/EDDIC analysis at this time. Re-enter this skill if any signal below appears in future customer conversations — the tool will re-classify based on the new picture.

## Dimension-driven signals (aligned with Classification axes)
- New use case or workload scoped on top of the commercial ask *(Solution complexity)*
- Scope expands from one use case to platform / architecture *(Solution complexity)*
- Customer asks AWS to bring in a Solution Architect to design — conversation has left pricing *(Decision cycle)*
- Timeline stretches beyond original window *(Decision cycle)*

## People-driven signals (additional, not in the 4 dimensions)
- Second stakeholder joins ("my manager wants to take a look too")
- New decision-maker appears (VP / CFO joins)
- Decision-makers count crosses 3, or any C-level joins
- Named competitor surfaces (Azure / Alibaba Cloud / GCP)

One trigger hit = re-run classification. Classification only ratchets upward — never downgrade.

我看到本会话中已经有以下 skill 输出。为了避免把别的商机的信息混进来，请逐项告诉我：

[For each visible skill output in conversation:]
- **[skill_name]** — 这个输出是为 **[customer_name] / [opportunity_name]** 跑的吗？
  请回复：
  - `confirmed` — 是的，同客户 + 同商机
  - `assumed` — 同客户但不同商机，或者不确定（信心会被打到中以下）
  - `unrelated` — 不是这单的，请忽略

举例回复格式：
- account-context: confirmed
- contact-profiling: confirmed
- bttroc: assumed
- engagement-plan: unrelated

⚠️ 标 `unrelated` 的 skill 输出会被完全忽略，不会用作推断依据。
⚠️ 如果你没有跑过相关 skill，或者所有都是 `unrelated`，推断质量会很弱（基本全 No），建议改选 Option B 自己填表单。
```

**Implementation rules:**
- Enumerate every skill that has produced output in the current Dali conversation. Use Dali orchestrator to list session-visible skill outputs.
- If none exist, render `view:phase1a-auto.no-context-warning` instead (see below) and do NOT proceed.
- The user's response builds the relevance map (Tier 2 input to M.3-Auto).
- Default for any skill not mentioned by the user: `unrelated` (safest assumption).

### view:phase1a-auto.no-context-warning

Rendered when context check finds zero usable skill outputs (none visible OR all marked unrelated).

```
我手头没有可用的 context — 自动推断会几乎全空白（Scorecard 大部分为 No / 信心低）。

建议改选：
- A — 上传已有 Scorecard
- B — 填表单（约 10–15 分钟）

请回复 A 或 B。或者继续，我会按"全 No / 低信心"基线生成一份默认 Scorecard 给你审阅（不推荐）。
```

### view:phase1a-auto.review-card

This is the most important user-facing surface in the auto-inference path. Render rules:

```
# Auto-Inferred Scorecard — 请审阅 / Please Review

ℹ️ 这是 AI 基于 Dali 其他 skill 的输出推断的 Scorecard。整体推断信心：**[overall_confidence: 高 | 中 | 低]**。

**证据来源分布：**
- [tier_3_confirmed_count] 条由 confirmed_current 的 skill 输出支持（信心可达 高）
- [tier_3_assumed_count] 条由 assumed_current 的 skill 输出支持（信心 capped at 中）
- [tier_1_count] 条由你的商机描述支持
- [default_no_count] 条因无足够信息默认为 No（信心 低）

**Context 使用情况：**
- 已用：[列出 confirmed_current + assumed_current 的 skill 名称]
- 已忽略：[列出 unrelated 的 skill 名称]
- 未跑：[列出本会话中没有跑过、对推断有帮助的 skill — 如 post-meeting-report, business-insight 等]

**基本信息（你提供）：**
- 客户：[customer_name]
- 商机：[opportunity_name]
- 当前阶段：[current_stage]
- 分级：[tier]

## 推断的评分（按元素分组）

[For each in-scope element:]

### [Element code] — [Element name]
**推断得分：[score]/[max] = [percent]% · 信心：[高 | 中 | 低]**

[For each statement under this element:]

| 陈述 | 推断 | 依据 | 信心 |
|---|---|---|---|
| [statement_text] | ✅ Yes / ❌ No | [source with source_tier + source_relevance — e.g., "Tier 3 confirmed: contact-profiling — David influence_score = 4" / "Tier 1: 你的描述" / "⚠️ 无足够信息推断"] | 高 / 中 / 低 |

---

## 接下来怎么做？

请回复一项：

- `全部接受` — 把推断结果作为 Scorecard，进入 Phase 2 Deal Assessment。
- `修改 [statement IDs，例如 M-S2, CH-S1]` — 我会逐项让你重打分。
- `修改 context 关联` — 回到 Step 3 重新标记每个 skill 的关联性（推断会基于新的 relevance 重跑）。
- `我自己填表单` — 放弃推断，跳到表单填写流程。

ℹ️ 所有下游报告会带"AI 推断"提示横幅。完整分析建议在关键 review 前用上传或填表单的方式校准。
```

**Implementation rules:**
- Per-element and overall confidence come from M.3-Auto.
- "Yes" inferences MUST cite a specific source with `source_tier` + `source_relevance` (e.g., `"Tier 3 confirmed: contact-profiling — David influence_score = 4"`, `"Tier 1: 用户商机描述"`).
- "No" inferences MUST cite either evidence-of-absence OR `"⚠️ 无足够信息推断"` — never silent.
- Statements list under each element follows the M.1.2 reference weights; render in the order they appear in the standard Scorecard template.
- The 3-line "证据来源分布" + "Context 使用情况" header is mandatory and computed from `inference_confidence.statement_count_by_tier` + `context_used`. This makes the user's data hygiene visible at a glance.

### view:phase1a-auto.statement-edit-prompt

When user replies `修改 [IDs]`, render one prompt per statement:

```
[element code] — Statement [n]:
"[statement_text]"

当前推断：[Yes | No]（依据：[source]）

请回复新的答案：`Yes` / `No` / `保持`。
```

After all edits collected, re-compute element scores and re-render `view:phase1a-auto.review-card`.

---

## Phase 1B Templates

### view:phase1b.parse-error

```
The file format does not meet requirements. Please use the latest Scorecard template for your tier.
```

### view:phase1b.tier-mismatch-prompt

Two variants based on M.4 outcome:

**Lenient mismatch (Simple + MEDDPICC uploaded):**
```
Classification is Simple (EDDIC), but a MEDDPICC Scorecard was uploaded. Analysis will read only the 5 EDDIC-relevant elements (I, E, DC, DP, CP) and ignore M, P, CH — that matches the locked tier. Confirm to continue?
```

**Strict mismatch (Strategic + EDDIC uploaded):**
```
Classification is Strategic (MEDDPICC), but an EDDIC Scorecard was uploaded. EDDIC is missing M, P, and CH — three elements critical for Strategic analysis. Two options:

(A) Downgrade classification to Simple and proceed with EDDIC.
(B) Keep Strategic and complete a full MEDDPICC Scorecard. Existing EDDIC answers can be reused where elements overlap.

Please confirm option (A) or (B).
```

### view:phase1b.consistency-anomaly

```
Scorecard parse complete with one anomaly:
[anomaly description from M.6 — specific cells, expected vs actual]

Confirm to proceed (analysis will use Basic Info Score-After as authoritative for Strategic tier), or re-upload a corrected Scorecard.
```

### view:phase1b.silent-handoff

```
✅ Scorecard parsed — [customer_name] / [opportunity_name] / [current_stage] / [score_display]. Proceeding to Deal Assessment.
```

`[score_display]` per M.6:
- Strategic: `[Score]/100`
- Simple: `EDDIC [Score]/63 = [Z]%`

`Proceeding to Deal Assessment.` is a V.0.5 translatable phrase.

### view:phase1b.full-extraction-dump

On-demand only. Renders:
- Basic Info table (Customer / Opportunity / Location / Type / Stage / Total Score)
- Per-element score breakdown (with weights and contributing statements)
- Consistency check (Basic Info Score-After vs per-element sum)
- Competitive Info status (named competitors, EB Job Title, Customer Business Objective, Potential Obstacles, AWS Solutions)
- Out-of-scope element values (Simple tier with M/P/CH data present)
- Source citation for each cell per V.0.1.

---

## Phase 2 Templates

### view:phase2.deal-assessment-card

Single consolidated card. **All adaptive sections are conditionally rendered — never show "skipped" or "not applicable" placeholders.** Section ordering is fixed; absent sections are omitted entirely.

**Verdict tag (Section 1) — selected by `alignment_result`:**

| `alignment_result` | Verdict tag |
|---|---|
| `Rollback Recommended` | 🔴 **建议回退到 [rollback_target] 阶段** |
| `Aligned — Strengthening Recommended` | ℹ️ **状态合理，建议补强** |
| `Aligned` | ✅ **状态合理** |
| `Advancement Ready` | 🚀 **可推进到 [next_stage]** |

If `alignment_result = Aligned` AND `progression_gate_passed = false`, append to verdict: `（但下一阶段门槛未达）`.

**Body template:**

```
# [Opportunity Name] — Deal Assessment

[Verdict tag from table above]

## 评分与阶段
- 总分：[score display per Score Display Rule]
- 当前阶段：[current_stage][, append "（[verdict tag]）" only if Rollback Recommended or Advancement Ready]
- [current_stage] 出口标准完成度：[aggregate]%

## 关键阻塞
**[primary_blocker.element]** · [primary_blocker.score]% — [primary_blocker.rationale_text — 3 sentences per M.14 (specialization of V.0.6): (1) what is missing concretely, (2) what it blocks, (3) visualizable stall]

[## 进下一阶段（[progression_gate_target]）还需要  ← only when Strategic tier AND progression_gate_passed = false]
[
[for each item in progression_gate_failed_conditions:]
- [condition text per V.0.6 — sales-readable, no Gate / Pass / 阈值 jargon. Examples:
  - "I = 67% → 目标 100%"
  - "CH = 33% → 目标 100%"
  - "已与 EB 接触并提及该项目"（when E S1 = No）
  - "总分 67/100 → 目标 ≥ 65"
]
]

## 本周行动
[one specific action with verifiable outcome, directly tied to Primary Blocker. Must specify contact, meeting type, or deliverable. Avoid generic phrasing.]

## 30 天目标
[up to 3 lines, format: Element ≥ X% · short verification phrase]

[## 为什么[verdict tag short form]  ← only when verdict is Rollback Recommended OR Advancement Ready, OR Aligned with progression_gate_passed = false]
[
2–3 sentences per V.0.6 (plain sales language, no defensive disclaimers). References:
- the specific exit criteria not yet met (from M.16 Foundation Risks / Progression Risks — but render bucket labels per V.0.6 Section B substitution)
- the specific gap elements ("Champion 验证", "基线指标 M") — not the gate names
- if Rollback Recommended AND Stakeholder Gate also triggered (Qualified-only): "同时，最终决策者尚未实质接触" — express as a fact, not as a gate trigger
- if Advancement Ready: state which exit criteria reached 100% and confirm next-stage readiness conditions
- if progression_gate_passed = false: explain in plain language what the next stage requires that's missing

Forbidden per V.0.6: defensive system-level disclaimer language ("Phase 3–6 will continue at reported stage", "warning banner", "diagnostic recommendation", "CRM data"). The audience is a sales rep who already knows analysis is advisory.
]
```

**Footer (Simple tier with out-of-scope data only):**
```
注：M / P / CH 已在 Scorecard 中填写，但 Simple 商机分级不计入分析。如需完整 MEDDPICC 分析，请以 Strategic 分级重新运行。
```

**Score display rule:**
- Strategic: `[Score]/100`
- Simple: `EDDIC [Score]/63 = [Z]%` primary; if Basic Info Score-After differs, append `(ref: Basic Info [W]/100)` in italics.

**Section rules (specialized; full vocabulary discipline per V.0.6):**

- **Section 关键阻塞** must state sales-readable rationale per M.14 — 3 sentences (what's missing / what it blocks / visualizable stall). Never bare scoring labels.
- **Section 进下一阶段** is rendered only at Strategic tier when `progression_gate_passed = false`. Each failed condition is one bullet per V.0.6 (no Gate / Pass / 阈值 jargon). **Do NOT** include a "已达标" list of passing conditions — only show what's missing. **Do NOT** include "进阶门槛是诊断性建议" disclaimer.
- **Section 本周行动** must specify contact, meeting type, or deliverable. Generic phrasing is forbidden per V.0.6 ("gather additional information", "align with stakeholders").
- **Section 30 天目标** elements come from M.10. Maximum 3.
- **Section 为什么…** is the consolidated explanation that replaces the old Phase 2.5 "Result paragraph + Advisory block + acknowledgment prompt". It is rendered ONLY for verdict states that need explaining — `Aligned` (default) is self-explanatory and skips this section.

**Implementation notes:**

- The legacy `view:phase25.alignment-card` and `view:phase25.acknowledgment-prompts` are no longer rendered. Their content has been merged into this single card.
- All internal Model terminology (Stakeholder Gate / Exit Criteria Gate / Stage Progression Gate / Pass 1 / Pass 2 / Pass 3) MUST NOT appear in the user-facing card per V.0.6 Section A5. The Model still uses these names; the View renders only consolidated business language.
- After rendering the card, Control proceeds with standard Phase Gating ("确认进入 Phase 3" or equivalent in detected language). Do NOT render a separate acknowledgment prompt.

---

## Phase 3 Templates

### view:phase3.exit-criteria-table

Header:
```
| # | Stage | Exit Criterion | Scorecard Completion % | Mapped Element (with %) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Each row from M.15. Status uses M.1.6 symbol vocabulary.

When one exit criterion has multiple element mappings, render multiple rows (one per mapping) with the criterion text repeated. Lowest-status precedence determines the criterion's aggregate status (rendered in `view:phase3.stage-aggregation`).

### view:phase3.stage-aggregation

For each stage from Prospect through current_stage:
```
**[stage]**: [aggregate]% (in-scope criteria mean) — [N] criteria evaluated
```

### view:phase3.stage-progression-recommendation

Selected by `alignment_result`:

- **Aligned:** `Analysis proceeds at [current_stage]; exit-criteria evidence supports the reported stage.`
- **Aligned — Strengthening Recommended:** `Analysis proceeds at [current_stage]. Current-stage aggregate completion is [aggregate]% (60–79% range); strengthen remaining exit criteria before advancement.`
- **Rollback Recommended:** `Analysis proceeds at [current_stage]. Rollback to [rollback_target] was recommended because [stakeholder gate / exit-criteria gate / both gates] failed. ⚠️ Current-stage findings are potentially over-optimistic; foundation gaps listed below remain unresolved.`
- **Advancement Ready:** `Analysis proceeds at [current_stage]. Current-stage exit criteria at 100% — [next_stage] is supported by the evidence for advancement at the analyst's discretion.`

### view:phase3.risk-buckets

```
## Foundation Risk
[bullets from M.16 foundation_risks. Each bullet: "[stage] / [element] [score]% — [finding]". Empty bucket → render "None — prior-stage foundation is solid."]

## Progression Risk
[bullets from M.16 progression_risks. Inline contradictions are part of finding text, NOT a separate section.]

## MEDDPICC Risk
[bullets from M.16 meddpicc_risks. When element also appears in Foundation/Progression bucket, format as: "[element] [score]% — see Foundation Risk above."]
```

---

## Phase 4 Templates

### view:phase4.market-search

```
## Section 1 — Customer's Current Cloud & GenAI Stack
*Source: account-context skill*

- **Other cloud providers in use:** [output | "not available"]
- **GenAI / LLM providers in use:** [output | "not available"]

## Section 2 — Industry Buying Behavior
*Source: account-context skill (scoped by industry + Opportunity Location + Opportunity Type)*

- **决策因素 / Decision factors:** [output | "not available"]
- **采购痛点 / Procurement pain points:** [output | "not available"]
- **采购周期特征 / Buying cycle characteristics:** [output | "not available"]
- **技术考虑因素 / Technical considerations:** [output | "not available"]

## Section 3 — Same-Industry Customer References
*Source: solutions-search skill*

[customer names | one of:
- Chinese language: 找不到同行业的客户使用该方案
- English language: No customers in the same industry have been found using this solution.]
```

**Render rules:**
- "not available" preserved verbatim — no inference, no training-data substitution.
- Section 3 fallback string is exact — no adjacent-industry substitution.
- No "what this means for the deal" / "recommendation" section.

### view:phase4.compete-block

Rendered only when competitive-intelligence skill is called.

Sections (whatever competitive-intelligence skill returns):
- Competitor profiles
- Service-by-service comparison
- Battle cards
- Defensive posture
- Win/loss precedent

If competitive-intelligence reports thin intel on a specific competitor, surface the gap as-is. No web-search or training-data fallback.

CP covers four dimensions — direct rivals, DIY, competing priorities, status quo. competitive-intelligence skill covers direct rivals; the other three are flagged as one-line notes from Scorecard signals.

**Simple-tier no-competitor case:**
```
No named competitors in Competitive Info — competitive monitoring not triggered at Simple tier.
```

### view:phase4.provenance-note

```
Source: account-context skill + solutions-search skill + competitive-intelligence skill. Their internal data sources and methods are their own.
```

---

## Phase 5 Templates

### view:phase5.layer-a-table

```
| 评估项 / Element | 得分 / Score | Priority | 关联状态 / Relationship | 数据源 / Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Each row from M.17 layer_a_rows. Column rules:

- **评估项:** full label, e.g., "E — Economic Buyer".
- **得分:** `[score]/[max] = **[%]%**` (percentage bolded).
- **Priority:** `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `—` (— for 100% elements with `⚠️` flag, since they are at the score ceiling but flagged for related-element fragility).
- **关联状态:** text from M.14 `related_status_label` per its rules. Examples:
  - `关联 I (67%) 偏低`
  - `关联 CH (33%) 处于 At Risk`
  - `⚠️ 看似达标 — 关联 I (67%) 偏低`
  - `关联项均 ≥ 80%` (only when an element appears for other reasons; otherwise the row is skipped from Layer A entirely)
  - `—` (no related elements with material score gap)
- **数据源:** specific Scorecard row numbers / field names per V.0.1. Never bare "Scorecard".

Scope per M.1.1; show all in-scope elements except those at 100% with all related elements ≥ 80%.

No directional language ("拖累 / 受...拖累 / depends on / blocks / upstream / downstream") may appear in any cell.

### view:phase5.layer-b-cards

For each P0/P1 element from M.17 layer_b_cards:

```
### [element_label] ([score]%)

[_Diagnostic Evidence: [diagnostic_evidence_text]_  ← only when M.17 sets it]

**根本原因 / Root Cause:**
[root_cause_text — 2–4 sentences, causal not descriptive. Inference content tagged with ⚠️ per V.0.1. References to related elements must be fact-only — no directional verbs.]
```

Skip P2 elements.

**Diagnostic Evidence rendering:** one italic line stating the specific contradiction/anomaly. NOT a bulleted list of Nos. When M.17 returns null, omit the line entirely.

**Root Cause rendering:** never include "Impact if Unresolved" or "Recommendations" subsections.

### view:phase5.stakeholder-profiling

Source status declared at top of section per V.0.2 pattern:

- `Source: contact-profiling skill` (when skill returned output)
- `⚠️ contact-profiling skill not yet available — generating role-archetype profile from LLM internal knowledge as fallback.` (fallback)
- `Source: cxo-personas skill — [persona file name]` (when EB is C-level and the skill returned a persona)
- `⚠️ cxo-personas skill not available — proceeding without CxO overlay.` (when EB is C-level but the skill is not connected)

When `no_persona_mode = true` (EB not identified), source status renders as:
- `Source: LLM 内部知识 / role archetypes — Scorecard 中未提供 EB 职位，按角色原型生成。`

Then the body:

```
### a. 客户接触人画像 / Contact Profiling
[tone, priorities, cultural considerations, rapport-building approach, question-sequencing principles — content from contact-profiling skill or fallback]

### b. CxO Persona  ← ONLY when eb_identity is C-level AND cxo-personas skill returned a persona
[CxO-specific overlay: decision levers, technical priorities, etc.]
```

**Role labeling discipline (HARD — applies to every contact rendered in this section):**

- Every contact carries exactly one MEDDPICC role tag: **EB**, **Champion**, **Champion candidate**, or **Coach**. No other role label is permitted in user-facing output.
- Contacts surfaced from Remarks / Notes / 备注 free-text are normalized per **M.7 free-text rules** before rendering. Do NOT render raw labels like "Supporter" / "Sponsor" / "Stakeholder" — substitute the M.7 `meddpicc_classification`.
- When citing the original Scorecard text, keep the raw word inside the quote, then append the M.7-derived classification in parentheses. Example:
  - ✅ `Sheet1 备注："确认了 supporter 是 David"（按 MEDDPICC 框架归类为 Coach: Champion 元素 33% 未达验证门槛）`
  - ❌ `David: Supporter`
- A `Champion candidate` tag is permitted ONLY when M.7's gating logic produced it. Otherwise default to `Coach`.

**Do NOT** include a "What This Means for Your Next Move" section. Tactical implications appear as `view:phase5.persona-traits-applied` blocks inside the question section.

### view:phase5.persona-traits-applied

Rendered for each P0/P1 element when `no_persona_mode = false`:

```
> Persona traits applied:
> (1) [trait — citing specific Persona attribute, e.g., "CTO prioritizes latency, QPS, ROAS over generic ROI — use quantitative metrics in M-related questions."]
> (2) [trait]
> (3) [trait]  ← optional third
```

Skipped entirely when `no_persona_mode = true`.

### view:phase5.verification-questions

For each P0/P1 element from M.19 output:

```
### [element_label] ([score]%)

[view:phase5.persona-traits-applied — if applicable]

**Q1.** [main_question]
- *Purpose:* [purpose]
- *Expected insights:* [expected_insights]
- *Follow-ups:* [follow_up_suggestions]

**Q2.** [main_question — only when budget allows]
- *Purpose:* ...
- *Expected insights:* ...
- *Follow-ups:* ...

**Q3.** [main_question — only for P0 elements with three justified angles]
- *Purpose:* ...
- *Expected insights:* ...
- *Follow-ups:* ...
```

**Optional EB hint at the end of Phase 5 (only when `no_persona_mode = true`):**

After all P0/P1 verification questions are rendered, append exactly this single line at the end of Phase 5 output:

```
ℹ️ 如果你能补充一下 EB 的角色（如 CFO / VP），下次问题会更精准。
```

Rules for the optional hint:
- Render only when `no_persona_mode = true`. Skip entirely when EB is identified.
- One line only — no header, no bullet list, no follow-up prompt.
- Does NOT pause execution. Phase 5 still ends with standard "确认进入 Phase 6" gating.
- The user's response (if any) is treated as input to the next conversation turn — if they provide a job title, M.18 picks it up via "prior user input in current conversation" path on subsequent calls.

P2 elements skipped (monitoring only). Total ≤ 12 main questions enforced by M.19; each P0 element generates 2–3 main, each P1 element generates 2 main.

**Do NOT prepend** any "⚠️ No EB identified — questions are not persona-tuned" warning. The hint above is the only acknowledgment of degraded mode in user-facing output.

---

## Phase 6 Templates

### view:phase6.action-plan

```
# [Opportunity Name] — Action Plan

[view:shared.warning-banner — when rollback_recommended = true]

## 1. Current Position
[score display per M.20.1] | Current Stage: [current_stage] ([alignment_result — for Rollback, append "→ [rollback_target]"]) | [current_stage] completion [aggregate]%

_Context — unfinished exit criteria feeding the strategies below:_
- **Prior stage ([prior_stage_name])**: [element] = [score]% — [specific gap]
- **Current stage ([current_stage_name])**: [element] = [score]% — [specific gap]
- [additional bullets, max 5]

---

## 2. Winning Strategies (背景叙事)

For each Strategy from `winning_strategies`:

```
**S1** — [strategy.title] · [strategy.target]
_Rationale: [strategy.rationale]_
```

Render as 1 line per strategy plus 1 italic rationale line below. No nested weekly action details inside the strategy block.

---

## 3. Weekly Plan (执行视角)

For each `{week, actions[]}` entry from `weekly_actions`:

```
### Week N（本周）  ← "本周" tag only on the soonest week (W1)
- [action.description]  ［[strategy_tags joined with · ]］
- [...]
```

Render rules:
- Each action is one bullet line, no nested sub-bullets.
- Strategy tags appear in trailing brackets, multi-tag separated by `·` (e.g., `[S1·S2·S3]`).
- Tag-only ASCII brackets — no badge styling, no color.
- Each action stays under `ACTION_DESCRIPTION_MAX_CHARS`.
- Weeks with no action are skipped.
- Calendar-event de-duplication has already been applied in Model layer (M.20). View does not re-merge or re-split.

[when M.21 set extended horizon:]
_Horizon extended to [weekly_horizon] weeks because [horizon_extension_reason]._

---

## 4. Key Success Metrics (30-day targets)

For each metric from `success_metrics`:

```
- ✅ [Element] ≥ [threshold]% — [verification condition: objective, observable]  ［[strategy_tag][, optional · 来源 W[N]–W[M]]］
```

Strategy tag uses the single id (e.g., `S1`); optional `source_week` field appends as `· 来源 W3–W5` to trace which weekly actions feed this metric.
```

**Render constraints (per M.20):**
- Action-first weekly view (samples in M.20). Same-calendar-event actions are merged once with multi-tag, never duplicated across strategies.
- Each action ≤ 100 chars.
- No "Immediate Next Step" footer — W1 first action covers it.
- No 🔴🟠🟡 priority tags — W-numbering carries time semantics.
- Score display matches Phase 2 exactly.
- Strategy 1 targets the Primary Blocker (per M.20 rule 3).
- Number of Strategies = number of Metrics = number of Phase 2 30-day targets (≤ 3).

---

## Phase 7 Templates

### view:phase7.save-path-prompt

```
报告要存到哪里？直接回车使用当前目录，或指定一个路径（例如 `~/Desktop`、`~/Documents/OP-Reports/`）。

Where should the report be saved? Press Enter for current directory, or specify a path (e.g., `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents/OP-Reports/`).
```

### view:phase7.delivery-confirmation

```
✅ Reading report generated: [absolute file path]

Sections rendered:
- Header + Rollback Banner ([shown / omitted])
- Phase 2 Deal Assessment ([alignment_result])
- Phase 3 Exit Criteria ([N] rows, [M] stages)
- Phase 4 Market & Competitive ([full / Simple-tier lite / omitted])
- Phase 5 Element Gap ([P0_count] P0 + [P1_count] P1 cards)
- Phase 5 Stakeholder Profiling ([N] stakeholders)
- Phase 5 Verification Questions ([N] questions across [M] elements)
- Phase 6 Action Plan ([N] strategies, [W_count] weekly actions)

Open the file in a browser to view. For PDF or Word copies, reply "导出 PDF" or "导出 Word".

_Model snapshot stored at `~/.dali/opportunity-progression/snapshots/{filename}.json` (machine-only; no user action needed)._
```

For Path B (jumped from earlier than Phase 6), explicitly list omitted sections.

For naming fallback (Customer slug instead of Opportunity slug), append a one-line note.

The Model snapshot footnote is appended as the last line. If snapshot write failed (M.24 surfaces error), replace footnote with: `_Model snapshot save failed: {error_message}._`

### view:phase7.export-confirmation

```
✅ [PDF / Word] exported: [absolute file path]
```

---

## V.HTML.0 — HTML Render Pipeline

```
M.22 → data dict → Jinja2 template (templates/opportunity-progression.html.j2) → M.23 → write HTML
```

Jinja2 settings: `autoescape=True`, `trim_blocks=True`, `lstrip_blocks=True`. Reference: `examples/render_sample.py`.

**Visual system (fixed, no deviation):**
- MD3 palette, primary `#6750A4`.
- Tailwind via CDN; Material Symbols icons.
- Max-width `6xl`; cards `28px` radius; pill badges `100px` radius.
- Stepper with circle nodes.
- **Typography:** Latin → Amazon Ember; CJK → 思源黑体 SC (Source Han Sans SC). HTML/PDF: `font-family` chain in template + `Noto Sans SC` Google Fonts fallback. Silent system-default fallback if unavailable.

## V.PDF.0 — PDF Export Format Rules

Invoke `examples/export_pdf.py` with the rendered HTML.

- Engine: headless Chromium via Playwright (preferred) or system Chrome fallback. NOT WeasyPrint — Tailwind CDN's JIT engine requires a real browser.
- Save next to the HTML with `.pdf` extension.
- On-demand only. Never produce PDF automatically alongside HTML.

## V.DOCX.0 — Word Export Format Rules

Invoke `examples/export_docx.py` with the same JSON data dict that fed the HTML render.

- Engine: `python-docx`. Builds Word document directly from data contract. Does NOT parse HTML.
- Word does not attempt pixel-for-pixel fidelity with HTML.
- Typography: Normal style `w:rFonts` — `ascii/hAnsi = Amazon Ember`, `eastAsia/cs = Source Han Sans SC`.
- Save next to the HTML with `.docx` extension.
- On-demand only.

**Schema sync rule (HARD):** any change to Phase 7 sections requires coordinated update to ALL of: `templates/opportunity-progression.html.j2`, `examples/sample-data.json`, `examples/export_docx.py`, `examples/render_sample.py` verification, `examples/README.md` schema note. Missing any one creates HTML/Word drift.
