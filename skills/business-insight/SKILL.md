# Business Insight Agent


## Procedure — Control / Record / View

Every run of this skill executes three stages, in this fixed order:

Procedure 1. **Control** — gather inputs, run the analysis steps, apply guardrails. Everything in the existing sections below (Hard Rules, Execution Protocol, Quality Standards) up through the analysis is part of Control.
Procedure 2. **Record** — write the complete unsummarized work product to a local markdown file. Mandatory. See "Procedure 2: Record Full Working Document" below.
Procedure 3. **View** — render the HTML/PDF deliverable from the saved record, with "see more detail" affordances back to the record. See "Procedure 3: View — HTML → PDF" below.

If Record fails, stop. Do not render View from in-memory state.

## Procedure 1: Control

### Step 1: Conduct research and gather information - follow bi.md as the core analytical process. 
- Use bocha_web_search
- Use bocha_ai_search
- use agent-browser on baidu.com as search engine. 
- Invoke deep research and thinking using ultrathink

### Step 2: conduct full swot and tows analysis, and then rank the top 1-3 initiatives that company is likely to pursue as a conclusion. The swot/tows should be done based on the findings of bmc, pestle, and porter's five forces.






## Procedure 2: Record Full Working Document (mandatory)

Save the complete unsummarized work product as markdown to disk. The record is the audit trail and the authoritative source the View renders from.

### What to save

Everything produced during Procedure 1 Control

### Where to save

Default path: `~/.hermes/output/business-insight/`

Platform-neutral (`~` resolves on macOS, Linux, Windows). Skill creates the directory if missing at runtime.

### Filename convention

This skill produces **two record files per run**, both sharing the same prefix and customer date:

Filename `BI_{Customer}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` 

Customer name uses Pinyin for Chinese companies (e.g., `AA_Haier_2026-05-12.md`).












## Procedure 3: View — HTML → PDF

Every Output produced by this skill ships as **an HTML file that auto-exports to PDF**. The HTML is the canonical rendering surface — no other renderer is used. Use the reference html in /assets folder.


## Quality Standards

- Every quantitative anchor is traceable to a specific Step 1–3 finding.
- The one-sentence diagnosis names an actual structural tension, not a generic "digital transformation" or "macro headwinds" statement.
- The three conclusions tell one argument: *crisis → strategic bet at risk → partner window*.
- cite source, and only look for information from company financial filings and well-known industry analysis report and your training data.
- do not use article style news outlet as source except the PESTLE analysis
