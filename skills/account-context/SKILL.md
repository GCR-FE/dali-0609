# account-context
Machine-readable customer context provider. Output is structured data for other agents to consume — not a user-facing deliverable.

Internally split into two procedures:
- **Procedure 1 — Analysis** (Steps 1–5): research, mapping, hypothesis generation, filtering.
- **Procedure 2 — Output** (JSON schema, persistence, downstream contract).

## Recency Mandate (BINDING)
### Rule 1 — General sources: 90-day window
### Rule 2 — Financial reporting: most recent filing only


## PROCEDURE 1 — ANALYSIS
### Step 1: Inputs

Inputs are passed as a structured dict (JSON object) by the calling skill's invocation framework. This skill does not parse free-text user messages directly. If any required field is missing, return error `inputs_missing` with the missing field list.

**Required:**
- `customer_name` (string)
- `industry` (string)

**Optional:**
- `sector` (string) — narrower industry segment; inferred from industry if absent
- `known_contacts` (list) — stakeholder contacts the caller has already gathered (name, title, role, sentiment, source). Tagged `[销售确认]` per Source Attribution.
- `known_notes` (string or list) — free-text customer notes the caller has accumulated. Tagged `[销售确认]`.
- `language` (string, default `en`) — output language for narrative fields. Allowed: `en` / `zh-CN` / `zh-TW`. Affects free-text fields (e.g., `power_dynamics.architecture_influencer` description, `dropped_claims.reason`); does NOT affect enum values, tag literals (`[销售确认]` etc. stay in source form), filenames, or proper nouns (customer name, AWS service names).
- `run_id` (string) — caller may supply; if absent, this skill generates one (UUID-style format; uniqueness within session scope is sufficient — opaque identifier, not required to be cryptographically random).

---

### Step 2: Account Foundation

Use web search, bocha, for the following research.

**Company Fundamentals:**
- Annual reports, investor presentations, 10-K/10-Q filings, financial reports from company website
- Company website (About, Products, Careers, Press pages)
- Recent earnings call transcripts or summaries

**Market Position:**
- Industry reports and market share data
- Analyst coverage and ratings
- Competitive landscape (cross-reference with market-intelligence peer/competitor section)

**Technology & Digital:**
- CTO/CIO interviews, conference talks, blog posts
- Job postings (reveal tech stack and priorities)
- Technology partnerships and vendor relationships
- Patent filings and R&D investments

**Organization & People:**
- Leadership team bios and recent changes
- Organizational structure (from annual reports, LinkedIn, press)
- Employee count, growth rate, key hiring areas
- Glassdoor/culture signals

**Competitive Landscape at the Account:** Capture structural/commercial competitive position at the account from public sources only. (Internal commercial data — actual contract values, AWS-side discount programs, internal POC trackers — is out of scope for this skill; downstream skills with access to internal systems will layer those in.)

- **Existing cloud agreements** — Azure EA, GCP committed-use agreement, Alibaba Cloud frame contract, Oracle Cloud ULA, etc. — contract type, scope, approximate value if public, renewal/expiry if known
- **Preferred-vendor or strategic-supplier status** — public preferred-vendor lists, joint press releases, co-branded case studies
- **Active competitor POCs / pilots** — publicly disclosed Azure, GCP, Snowflake, Databricks, OpenAI, Alibaba POCs running now
- **Competitor account-level investment** — named executive sponsorships, co-innovation labs, co-marketing commitments
- **Procurement / vendor-consolidation posture** — public statements, board-level commitments

| Dimension | Current State | Evidence | Source | Implication for AWS |
|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| Existing cloud agreements | | | | |
| Preferred-vendor status | | | | |
| Active competitor POCs | | | | |
| Competitor exec sponsorship | | | | |
| Consolidation posture | | | | |

**Other Cloud & GenAI Footprint:** Research the customer's existing non-AWS cloud and GenAI usage.

- `"[Company] Azure" OR "[Company] Google Cloud" OR "[Company] Alibaba Cloud" OR "[Company] Oracle Cloud"` — incumbent hyperscalers
- `"[Company] OpenAI" OR "[Company] Anthropic" OR "[Company] Gemini" OR "[Company] Databricks" OR "[Company] Snowflake Cortex"` — GenAI platforms and LLM vendors
- `"[Company] GenAI" OR "[Company] LLM" OR "[Company] generative AI" OR "[Company] AI platform"` — internal AI initiatives and announced partnerships
- Conference talks, case studies, vendor announcements naming the customer
- Record: vendor, workload/use case, confidence (`[销售确认]` / `[AI推断]` / `[网络搜索]`), source URL

**Customer Buying Behavior:** Research how this customer buys technology.

- `"[Company] RFP" OR "[Company] procurement" OR "[Company] vendor selection"` — procurement patterns
- `"[Company] technology contract" OR "[Company] multi-year agreement"` — contract structure preferences
- `"[Company] preferred vendor" OR "[Company] strategic supplier"` — vendor consolidation tendencies
- Public evidence of decision cycles, POC requirements, consensus vs. top-down buying, risk tolerance, signing authority
- Record: buying pattern, evidence, source URL, implication for AWS engagement

Store all findings with source URLs. Every claim must trace back to a source.

### Step 3: Organization Chart Mapping: Industry Standard → Current State (Public + Caller-Provided) → Gap Identification

**Step 3.1: Generate Industry Standard Org Chart**

Based on customer's industry, size, and business model, generate the typical org chart:
- C-suite roles and reporting lines
- Key VP/Director-level functions
- Technology organization structure (CTO vs. CIO, platform teams, data teams, security)
- Business unit structure

| Level | Role | Reports To | Key Responsibilities | Typical Headcount Range |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|

**Step 3.2: Map Current Known Org Chart**

Use **public web research and caller-provided inputs only**.

1. **Public research:** annual reports, press releases, company website leadership pages, LinkedIn, conference speaker pages, earnings call participant lists.
   - `"[Company Name] leadership team"`
   - `"[Company Name] CTO" OR "[Company Name] CIO" OR "[Company Name] VP Engineering"`
   - `"[Company Name] organizational structure"`
   - `"[Company Name] executive team"`
2. **Market-intelligence cross-reference:** check the market-intelligence output for any leadership changes (new CEO/CTO/CIO, executive departures) in the last 6 months and incorporate.
3. **Caller-provided:** if the caller passed in `known_contacts`, include those entries.

| Level | Name | Title | Reports To | Source | Last Verified |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|

Mark the source per entry: `[网络搜索] (URL)`, `[网络搜索] Market-Intelligence`, or `[销售确认]`.

**Step 3.3: Identify Gaps**

| Expected Role | Current Status | Gap Type | Impact on AWS Sales | Recommended Action |
|---------------|---------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|

Gap Types:
- **Unknown** — role likely exists but we don't know who fills it
- **Missing** — role may not exist in this organization
- **New** — recently created role (signals strategic priority)
- **Vacant** — role is open (hiring signal)

---

### Step 4: Relationship Map: Standard Categories → Map Known (Public + Caller-Provided) → Analyze

**Step 4.1: Stakeholder Categories**

For the customer's industry and size, identify standard stakeholder categories relevant to AWS:

| Category | Typical Roles | Why They Matter for AWS |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Technical Decision Makers | CTO, CIO, VP Engineering, Chief Architect | Architecture decisions, vendor selection |
| Business Line Owners | GM, VP Product, VP Operations | Workload owners, business case sponsors |
| Influencers | Enterprise Architects, Lead Engineers, Data Scientists | Technical evaluation, POC execution |
| Champions | Cloud Architects, DevOps Leads, Innovation Managers | Internal advocates, day-to-day partners |
| Blockers (potential) | Security Officers, Compliance Heads, incumbent vendor advocates | Can slow or stop deals |

**Step 4.2: Map Known Relationships**

Use **public web research, market-intelligence output, and caller-provided inputs only** (`known_contacts`, `known_notes`).

| Name | Title | Category | Relationship Strength (1-5) | Last Engagement | Engagement Channel | Sentiment | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|

Relationship Strength:
- 5 = Strong advocate, regular engagement, trusts AWS
- 4 = Positive, engaged, open to AWS
- 3 = Neutral, limited engagement
- 2 = Skeptical or disengaged
- 1 = Hostile or actively blocking

**Step 4.3: Relationship Gap Analysis**

| Critical Role | Current Coverage | Gap | Risk Level | Recommended Action |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|------------|-------------------|

**Step 4.4: Power Dynamics Summary**

Structured fields:
- `architecture_influencer` — who influences technical architecture choices
- `potential_champion` — who could champion an AWS deal internally
- `potential_blocker` — who could block, with reason
- `decision_culture` — `consensus` | `top_down` | `committee`

---

### Step 5: Customer IT Landscape: Hypothesis Generation → Validation

This is the hardest data to obtain. Generate an educated hypothesis from public signals.

**Step 5.1: Public Signal Collection**

- **Job postings:** `"[Company] careers" AND ("AWS" OR "Azure" OR "GCP" OR "Kubernetes" OR "Terraform" OR "Java" OR "Python" OR ".NET")`
- **Engineering blogs:** `"[Company] engineering blog" OR "[Company] tech blog"`
- **Conference talks:** `"[Company]" AND ("re:Invent" OR "KubeCon" OR "QCon" OR "tech conference")`
- **GitHub/Open source:** `"[Company]" site:github.com`
- **Technology partnerships:** `"[Company] partner" AND ("technology" OR "cloud" OR "platform")`
- **Vendor case studies:** `"[Company]" case study` on Snowflake, Databricks, MongoDB, Confluent, etc.
- **BuiltWith/Wappalyzer signals** when web presence available

**Step 5.2: IT Landscape Hypothesis**

| Layer | Hypothesized Technology | Confidence | Evidence | Source |
|-------|------------------------|------------|----------|--------|
| Cloud Platform(s) | | | | |
| Compute | | | | |
| Database | | | | |
| Data & Analytics | | | | |
| AI/ML & GenAI | | | | |
| DevOps/CI-CD | | | | |
| Security | | | | |
| Networking | | | | |
| Application Stack | | | | |
| Collaboration | | | | |
| CRM/ERP | | | | |
| Monitoring | | | | |

Confidence tags (per Source Attribution):
- `[销售确认]` — caller passed it in via `known_contacts` / `known_notes`. Use directly.
- `[网络搜索]` — multiple independent public sources confirm, OR single strong signal (job posting, blog, vendor case study) within 90-day window.
- `[AI推断]` — inferred from industry norm or role-archetype hypothesis only; no direct source. Suggest verification.

  "dropped_claims": [

  ]
}
```

## Procedure 2: Output Persistence

Default behavior: write the JSON to disk so downstream skills can consume it across sessions.

**Path:**
```
~/.kiro/cache/account-context/data/{customer_slug}/account-context_{customer_slug}_{YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ}.json
~/.kiro/cache/account-context/data/{customer_slug}/account-context_{customer_slug}_latest.json   # mirror of newest
```

- **Slug:** lowercase Latin chars, spaces → hyphens, Chinese characters preserved, strip path-unsafe characters (`/ \ : * ? " < > |`), truncate to 60 chars.
- **Timestamp:** ISO 8601 in UTC with `:` replaced by `-` for filesystem safety (e.g., `2026-05-18T10-32-15Z`). Second-level resolution; multiple runs in the same day produce distinct files.
- **Latest mirror:** `account-context_{customer_slug}_latest.json` is overwritten with each run; downstream skills should read this path when they need "the most recent context for this customer".
- **Self-describing payload:** the JSON `meta` block carries `skill_name`, `customer_name`, `report_run_date`, `run_id` (UUID v4), `schema_version` so downstream consumers do not parse filenames for routing.
- **Retention:** caller may keep all historical runs; this skill does not delete. Future Kiro maintenance may add automatic prune (e.g., keep most recent 10 + latest mirror per customer).
- **Return value:** the absolute path of the written timestamped JSON, the absolute path of `latest.json`, and the JSON object itself.
