# Solutions Architecture Search Agent


## Procedure — Control / Record / View

Every run of this skill executes three stages, in this fixed order:

1. **Procedure 1: Control** — gather inputs, run the analysis, apply guardrails, produce all analytical elements.
2. **Procedure 2: Record** — write the complete unsummarized work product to a local markdown file. Mandatory.
3. **Procedure 3: View** — render the results into a designed HTML page via `templates/render_ss.py` (Jinja2 pipeline). Visual reference: `./templates/OUTPUT_REFERENCE.html`.

## Procedure 1: Control - Core Objective (mandatory)

Given the **Top 3 Strategic Initiatives** from the `business-insight` skill, search the local knowledge base (`./references/`) for **proven architectures and case studies from customers in the same or adjacent industry facing the same business context**, and return ranked, evidence-backed **Solutions 搜索结果**. You should also search AWS service information from aws_docs and aws_knowledge.

### Required Input

Read **Top 3 Strategic Initiatives** from `business-insight`. Each initiative contains:
- Title
- Description
- Implied potential opportunity
- Customer industry and sector
- SWOT/TOWS context


### Knowledge Source

**REQUIRED: Load `references/INDEX.md`** for industry routing, then load the matching industry file from `references/industries/`.

**REQUIRED: Load `references/search-keywords.json`** to compose structured search queries (7 dimensions: industry verticals, workload services, challenge patterns, scale/performance terms, compliance constraints, Well-Architected pillars, and composite search phrases).

- `references/industries/` — per-industry pages (8 industries): Solution Maps, Asset Cards with KPI, customer references, AWS services
- AWS documentation through aws_docs and aws_knowledge.

If the references folder nor the AWS documentation does not cover the requested industry, **state the coverage gap explicitly** and do not fabricate data.

### Step 1: Search Within Loaded Industry Documents

For **each of the Top 3 Strategic Initiatives**, execute the following 4 sub-steps in this exact sequence — do not skip, reorder, or parallelize.

#### 1a: Direct Industry + Capability Match

Read `./references/search-keywords.json` to generate structured search queries. The keyword framework contains 7 dimensions: industry verticals, workload services, challenge patterns, scale/performance terms, compliance constraints, Well-Architected pillars, and composite search phrases. Use these to compose targeted queries against the local knowledge base.

Search within the loaded wiki documents for architectures and case studies where a customer in the **same industry** deployed the **same AWS AI/cloud capability** to solve the **same business context**.

This is the highest-value match. A single strong direct match can anchor the entire recommendation.

#### 1b: Adjacent Industry, Same Pattern

If 1a is thin, search within loaded wiki documents for the **same architectural pattern in an adjacent industry** where the business context rhymes.

- FSI fraud detection ↔ retail personalization fraud ↔ gaming anti-cheat (streaming + ML inference)
- Healthcare document processing ↔ insurance claims IDP ↔ legal contract analysis (Textract + Bedrock)
- Manufacturing predictive maintenance ↔ utilities grid monitoring (IoT + time-series + ML)

Flag that the match is by pattern, not industry.

#### 1c: Displacement / Coexistence Context

If the business-insight output (or a merged-in `account-context` run) carries the customer's **Other-Cloud & GenAI Footprint**, cross-reference it within the loaded wiki documents. For each incumbent (Azure, GCP, OpenAI, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) search for:
- Migration playbooks
- Competitive battlecards
- Coexistence or integration patterns

Every returned architecture should explicitly state whether it's a displacement, coexistence, or greenfield pattern relative to the customer's footprint.

If the footprint is not provided, skip this sub-step and flag it as a coverage gap.

#### 1d: Buying-Behavior Fit

If the business-insight output (or a merged-in `account-context` run) carries **Customer Buying Behavior**, filter results against it:
- If the customer prefers POCs → prioritize Immersion Days, workshops, Well-Architected Labs content
- If the customer is top-down → prioritize executive narratives, CxO decks, analyst-validated cases
- If the customer consolidates vendors → prioritize full-stack AWS reference architectures over point solutions
- If the customer is risk-averse → prioritize production-validated case studies with published outcomes

Deprioritize results that do not fit the buying behavior, even if they are technically strong matches. If buying behavior is not provided, default to production-validated case studies and flag as a coverage gap.

### Step 2: Enforce Strict Boundaries

After retrieval, apply these hard constraints:

1. **Only use content from `./references/`** , or AWS Documentation mcp tool— no external web search, no general knowledge augmentation, no creative inference beyond what the documents state
2. **`internal_only: true` documents** — their content MUST NOT appear in any customer-facing material. Use them for internal strategy only; cite them in internal-only blocks if needed
3. **No fabrication** — if the knowledge base does not contain a relevant reference, say so explicitly in the Coverage Gap. Do not invent, paraphrase beyond source, or substitute with public knowledge
4. **No stale content** — apply freshness tiers (see RAG Search Quality Guardrails below) based on metadata dates in the loaded documents

### RAG Search Quality Guardrails (RAG 检索质量护栏)

The knowledge base is accessed through a structured retrieval process. RAG retrieves by semantic similarity, not by truth or relevance — so every retrieval must pass the following guardrails before being included in the output. Silent retrieval failures are the #1 cause of bad recommendations.

#### Guardrail 1 — Query Decomposition (查询分解)

For each Strategic Initiative, execute a **minimum of 4 independent queries**, one per search step:

1. **Direct-industry query** — `[customer industry] [AWS capability] [business context]`
2. **Pattern query** — `[architectural pattern] [adjacent industry] reference architecture`
3. **Displacement query** — `[incumbent from footprint, if provided] migration playbook [AWS target service]` (skip if footprint not provided)
4. **Buying-behavior query** — one of: `[capability] Immersion Day workshop`, `[capability] CxO executive briefing`, `[capability] production customer case study [customer region]`

Do not send a single broad query. Broad queries are the single biggest source of semantic drift (e.g., "SAP" returning SAP Service Asset Planning content).

#### Guardrail 2 — Metadata Pre-Filter (元数据过滤)

Before ranking any retrieval, filter the corpus on hard metadata:

- **Freshness:** `last_reviewed_date >= today - 12 months` by default; override only with explicit user confirmation
- **Industry:** `industry IN [customer_industry, adjacent_industries]` — adjacent list must be explicit (FSI ⇄ insurance ⇄ fintech; healthcare ⇄ life sciences ⇄ insurance claims; manufacturing ⇄ utilities ⇄ logistics)
- **Content type:** `content_type IN [case_study, reference_architecture, battlecard, playbook, immersion_day_kit]` — never accept marketing brochure content as a primary reference
- **Region:** `region IN [customer_region, global]` when compliance or residency is in scope

If the metadata filter returns zero results, state so explicitly rather than loosening the filter silently.

#### Guardrail 3 — Multi-Retrieval Triangulation (多路召回交叉验证)

A reference qualifies as a **Strong** match only if it appears in **≥2 of the 4 queries** for the same Strategic Initiative. Single-query references are labeled **Thin** and flagged for user confirmation before inclusion.

This prevents one high-similarity-but-irrelevant document from dominating the output.

#### Guardrail 4 — Freshness Tier Labeling (新鲜度分级)

Every retrieved reference carries a freshness tier based on `last_reviewed_date`:

| Tier | Age | Confidence multiplier | Treatment |
|------|-----|-----------------------|-----------|
| Current | <6 months | 1.0 | Use as-is |
| Recent | 6–12 months | 0.8 | Use, label as Recent |
| Stale | 12–18 months | 0.5 | Use only if no Current/Recent exists, label as Stale, recommend refresh |
| Expired | >18 months | 0 | Exclude; note in Coverage Gap |

Apply the multiplier to the final ranking score — a slightly-less-relevant Current reference often beats a highly-relevant Expired one.

#### Guardrail 5 — Citation Validation (引用验证)

After generating a per-initiative block, **re-read every cited knowledge base document** and confirm that the specific claim (architecture summary, key services, outcome metric) actually appears in the source. If the source does not support the claim:

- **Drop the claim** — do not rephrase and keep
- **Note the drop** in the Coverage Gap section
- Do not invent a replacement URL

This is the single most important guardrail against LLM hallucination of citations.

#### Guardrail 6 — Coverage Gap Disclosure (覆盖缺口披露)

At the end of each per-initiative block, include a **Coverage Gap** note stating:

- Which of the 4 queries returned zero results
- Which freshness tiers were available (Current / Recent / Stale only)
- Whether an exact-industry match was found, or only a pattern match
- Any required filter that was relaxed (and why)

Silent gaps are worse than acknowledged gaps. A seller who knows "we have no Australian insurance case study, closest is Singapore banking" can plan around it; a seller who silently receives Singapore banking content labeled as insurance will misrepresent it to the customer.

#### Guardrail 7 — Match Strength Labeling (匹配强度标注)

Beyond the existing `Match Type` (Direct / Pattern / Displacement / Inspirational), label each reference with `Match Strength`:

- **Strong** — Direct match type + triangulated across ≥2 queries + Current freshness + citation validated
- **Moderate** — Pattern or Displacement match + triangulated + Recent or better + citation validated
- **Thin** — Single-query retrieval, or Stale, or citation partially validated — flag for user review before using in customer-facing material

#### Required Per-Initiative Search Evidence Block

Add this block to every per-initiative output (see Procedure 3 Data Schema):

```
Search Evidence:
- Queries executed: [list all 4+ queries verbatim]
- Retrievals confirming this reference: [which queries surfaced it, e.g., "Direct-industry + Displacement"]
- Freshness tier: [Current / Recent / Stale]
- Citation validated: [Yes — "claim X" confirmed in source on YYYY-MM-DD / Partial — Y claims validated, Z dropped / No — reference excluded]
- Match strength: [Strong / Moderate / Thin]
- Coverage gap for this initiative: [list missing dimensions or "none"]
```

### Ranking Criteria

Rank recommendations per initiative by:
1. **Match Strength** — Strong > Moderate > Thin (replaces naive cosine ranking)
2. **Direct match** — same industry, same capability, same business context (highest priority within strength tier)
3. **Pattern match** — adjacent industry, same architectural pattern
4. **Displacement match** — content specifically addressing the customer's incumbent vendor
5. **Inspirational** — novel approach from unrelated domain that could apply

Prefer production-validated cases with published customer outcomes over theoretical architectures.

## Procedure 2: Record Full Working Document (mandatory)

Save the complete unsummarized work product as markdown to disk. The record is the audit trail and the authoritative source the View renders from.

### What to save

Everything produced during Procedure 1 Control, in full and unsummarized:

- **Inputs received** — the complete Top 3 Strategic Initiatives consumed from `business-insight`, including industry context, SWOT/TOWS matrix, other-cloud/GenAI footprint (if provided), and buying behavior (if provided)
- **Per-initiative search execution log** — for each of the Top 3 Strategic Initiatives:
  - All queries executed (verbatim, all 4+ per initiative)
  - Raw retrieval results per query (file path, section, relevance snippet)
  - Metadata pre-filter decisions (what was included/excluded and why)
  - Triangulation matrix (which references appeared in which queries)
  - Freshness tier assigned to each retrieved reference
  - Citation validation results (claims confirmed, claims dropped, with source file and date)
  - Match strength classification (Strong / Moderate / Thin) with justification
- **Per-initiative output blocks** — the full formatted output for each initiative (recommended references, architecture summaries, key services, customer context similarity, buying-behavior fit, applicability notes, risks, search evidence block, coverage gap)
- **Consolidated summary table** — the final initiative × top reference × match type × next-step asset table
- **Coverage gaps aggregate** — all disclosed gaps across all initiatives, consolidated for quick review
- **Guardrail audit trail** — any filters relaxed, any references excluded by guardrails, any claims dropped during citation validation

### Where to save

Default path: `~/.hermes/output/solutions-search/`

Platform-neutral (`~` resolves on macOS, Linux, Windows). Skill creates the directory if missing at runtime.

### Filename convention

| File | Filename | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Solutions Search working document | `SS_{Customer}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` | Complete unsummarized audit trail |

Customer name uses Pinyin for Chinese companies (e.g., `SS_Haier_2026-05-12.md`).

## Procedure 3: View — Render Output (mandatory)

Render the Procedure 1 results into a designed HTML page. The complete output is named **Solutions 搜索结果**.

### Rendering Pipeline

**REQUIRED: Load `templates/sample_data.json`** for the complete JSON schema example. Then render:

1. **Generate structured data (JSON)** from the Procedure 1 analysis results following the schema defined in `templates/render_ss.py` (see DATA_SCHEMA).
2. **Fill the Jinja2 template** via `python templates/render_ss.py input.json output.html`.
3. **Output the rendered HTML file** — styled with Material Design 3 (Google Sans, MD3 color tokens, 28px rounded cards, Material Symbols icons, responsive grid).

**REQUIRED: Load `templates/OUTPUT_REFERENCE.html`** as the visual reference — shows a complete rendered example (Haier Smart Home).

## Quality

### DO:
- Only use `./references/` and AWS Documentation as your knowledge source
- Anchor every recommendation to a specific Strategic Initiative
- Cite exact file paths and sections; provide URLs for all claims
- State the match type (direct / pattern / displacement / inspirational)
- Prioritize production-validated case studies over theoretical architectures
- Map references to the customer's other-cloud/GenAI footprint when provided
- Flag content older than 12 months as stale; exclude content older than 18 months
- Disclose coverage gaps explicitly — silent gaps are the #1 failure mode
